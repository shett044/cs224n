So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we won't be at the best time, and you need to put the systems on their site.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, in having to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or the one to be loved to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of them make medical decisions, and in fact to make financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that you need to take away from the rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
They all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart attack heart disease.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you may have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, and you are even likely to know people that <unk>
So you say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that is supposed to ask for what most doctors don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number needs to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to have surgery in any medical procedure before you help one person.
And you must think of what kind of statistic <unk> is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor wouldn't tell me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the doctor, and if it's somebody's fault of the scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well <unk>
But estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works only from 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number that the number needs to treat the most widely <unk> which you think is it?
How many people have to take it for before you help a person?
300.
This is according to the research of the traditional researchers who would <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I'm going to explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, brain stroke or another <unk> event.
Now maybe you think, "Well, one probability in 300 of my <unk>
Why don't you <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic -- and it is, <unk> of the immune effects. Right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced in five percent of patients.
And those include <unk> <unk> and <unk> pain -- but now they think, <unk> five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still just take the <unk>
But a moment.
So remember, you don't think clearly.
So think about how you can do this with the time, so they don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take a drug, right? A person has five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get rid of the drug that will help you medicine.
I don't say they should or not take the <unk>
I just say that you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic is required, it's part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have the right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air of the crash, but actually this number that we need to treat is quite typical.
So for the surgery that is more done in the top men in the 1950s, <unk> of prostate cancer, the number necessary to treat is <unk>
So it's 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, they produce 50 percent of patients.
Those include <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky enough and it's one of that 50 percent effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think of before the questions that you can make is that we would push the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a more short life of pain, or a longer life that could have much pain to the end?
These are the things they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change on the heat of the moment, but at least you are trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you shut up a lot of systems.
There's a evolutionary reason for this.
Face with a predator, you don't need the system to be <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism in those things, you don't react to be lunch for lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thought rational, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we need to help us think about the future in this kind of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail in time.
The idea is to think about the future how it might be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help minimize harm, or to prevent things that bad things happened in the first place.
I went to the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a <unk> of combination with the door, with a key to the gate of the entrance to the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have a lot of cards that I haven't ordered and lots of text messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite music.
It means <unk> <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even <unk>
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> where you see it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> may never be <unk> to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the story of the American system of signs, <unk> in addition to my own story.
The language of French signs came over the 1980s, and over the time of time, they mixed with local signs, and it developed the language that we know as <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a single person who lives in a sound world, is as if I lived in a foreign world, following your rules, they will make behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've been learned, for example ...
"You don't have the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise by eating the bag of potato <unk>
"I don't <unk> and when you're eating, make sure they don't <unk> the <unk> in the <unk>
This is all called <unk> <unk>
I might think of the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> from sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is coming to the next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> for decide.
We were going to move it up.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> has no notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sound through the subtle <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the sign to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do this be with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I just have four lines on the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an art residence there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was hearing.
Now the sound has entered my territory of art.
I'm going to tell you more of the art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it's not only experiences through your ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my art practice.
And all they had taught me as soon as the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized the sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was some of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my art job, or I could get it away.
I chose to stand up.
There's a massive culture around speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as equal to my voice.
That way I'm able to be relevant in the current society.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> your voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value that just like taking a loan out with a very high interest rate.
If you're not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could go to <unk> and not have any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic environment, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot be capturing and expressing in the paper.
And the same can be said from a concept in <unk>
The two are very space and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a piano metaphor for you to understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide in a lot of different <unk>
If you spread a <unk> different for each finger while the piano, like facial expression, the body movement, the speed, the shape of hand and so, while the piano, the English is a linear language, just as if you're going to get a key at once.
However, <unk> is more like <unk> you need the top 10 fingers to express a very clear concept or an idea in <unk>
If just a key would change the chord -- it would create a completely different meaning of it.
The same thing happens with music in terms of tone and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal is <unk> in that."
This is the <unk> sign in that."
I'm looking at.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at the <unk> through the music?
If I had to create a sign and put it over and over again, it could become like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is all day."
If you <unk> it and <unk> the visually speed, you see it as a piece of music.
All day.
I feel like the same can be said to <unk> the <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents the time in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> it's two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at once, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of <unk> <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically I think automatically <unk>
Look at <unk> right, <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can do it with me?
All of the hands.
So now we're going to do it both in your head as well as <unk> <unk> or <unk> the same time."
Yes, great.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please go back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
And look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in the head and the chest but the chest but they transmit very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And only because the <unk> doesn't have sound, automatically doesn't have social value.
We have to start questioning what defines the social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn the music.
The <unk> is a rich, rich, and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to give you your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience from our visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can tell me, "Can you look at it, but then you have to <unk>
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led to all of these wonderful places where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a innocence bubble or a bubble of ignorance I should say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the real truth.
When I get older, I learned that adults are also <unk> and that they're not very good at cleaning up each other.
Time country, now I'm adult and teach and invention in the <unk> school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, we would have <unk> <unk> and no, you're not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it away.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic.
It's a bit creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ship and networks, to collect these plastic pieces to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very expensive to use these huge ones.
So along with my students, 15 to 15 years old, we dream about inventing a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> <unk> work so that the kids are very <unk> they can also participate.
And I'll tell you the kids who manipulate tools are cool and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce it to the size that we found in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave you to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to get them into something that we hope to work.
So we decided that instead of collecting plastic pieces of plastic, only information.
By using a robot, we took an image of this <unk> the children get a lot of the robots.
And then we made it very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we made light bulbs and web cameras on top of it, and they put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image was captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating down through the sensor while the computer on board process process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
We published this step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else will get it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to make it immediately.
<unk> research on my problem -- but my students in Hong Kong are very well <unk>
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and they <unk> with this <unk>
A child, maybe less than 10 years -- cleaning a oil spill, only using the hands of the world's largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water that <unk> the water where the water grows in.
You can also see that the water is brown and the mud and the oil also are brown color and when everything gets <unk> it's very hard to see what there is in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what is in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can spread through all kinds of substances that produce different trials, which can help identify what's in the water.
We had this prototype with a sensor and sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
<unk> research on a problem to <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe to go a more difficult problem, and also closest to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it would make a lot of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroy various cities on the east coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, a local nuclear station on the water.
And today, according to the reports about 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the coast -- and the vast majority of time, it has safe blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the crash and research with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't know.
But every night we reported at the center of <unk> here you see using different masks use.
It might seem that they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all your life.
Together with them we discussed the data that day and we talked about what we were going to do, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the <unk> <unk> map to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So we were able to see that the radioactive dust <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this we organize a civil expedition, the closest to the nuclear power to date.
We get up to a 1.5 thousand miles of nuclear power, and with the follow-up aid of the area we were collecting the ocean ocean sediments with a <unk> <unk> as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's been more and more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so much, so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we become the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's at the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, in a <unk> basically can be built almost from everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We thought about things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help in mobility of the population of advanced age transforming its standard wheelchair into new self-driving cars.
<unk> oil and <unk> are terrible, terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the awful truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, scientists, scientists, creators, we need to prepare the next generation to care about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures of large-scale design.
One is made from thousands of steel parts of steel, the other one of the silk silk <unk>
One of them is synthetic the other organic.
One is imposes over the environment, the other thing I thought of.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that fight for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool of <unk>
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all of the information that was required by every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> manufacturing and mass production.
<unk> lines have <unk> a world made out of place, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think about their objects as <unk> from <unk> and different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with light-activated pore.
The skins of the back is more thick with little <unk>
One is acting primarily as we filter the other primarily as barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no <unk> there's no <unk>
It's a system that changes its functionality by the variation by <unk>
Here's a broken screen that represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and an architect in working on the <unk> and the gene, between the assembly and the organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis, and <unk> shows on the two screens after me.
My work, in its very simple level, trying to unite these two visions of the world, moving away from assembly and approaching growth.
You'll probably ask why now?
Why wasn't it possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment, in history, a weird moment, where we are going to get four disciplines that offers a access to the tools we never had access before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I thought.
Please meet the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, and tools and tools through large-scale scales, like this robotic arm with a 24-hour <unk> <unk> which one day not far too far to print <unk> buildings and graphics to the nanoscale made out of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every aperture is the only size to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the small <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing collaborator, we print this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> between the cells -- I'll show you more objects like that.
This hull combines rigid materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a functional scanner system.
That designers have access to this high-performance <unk> and the <unk> instruments allows to design products that are <unk> not just the way of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed an acoustic <unk> a chair to the very structural <unk> and also it absorbs sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator, came back to nature to <unk> and by designing this pattern of <unk> surface becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the points of pressure in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, changes its functionality not by the addition of another material or another <unk> but <unk> and <unk> the material.
But it's nature <unk>
There's no parts in nature?
I was not raised in a religious Jew but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories from the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and define a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of the <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> <unk>
For that first tree -- there would be no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, the land did grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The earth created a world made of place.
I often ask myself, "What would be the design if the objects made out of one <unk>
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we are looking for the material to <unk> the kind of material of the tree and <unk> and we found it.
The second most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons being produced by organisms.
We thought that if we could tune your <unk> we could generate structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  <unk> a bunch of <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced <unk> <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of <unk> from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures -- it built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material about the march and create these <unk> structures made of one <unk> material -- 100 percent recyclable
When the pieces are ready, you stop it to find a natural form of contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process used to contain <unk> <unk> that first showed up on the planet does <unk> billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the genetically engineered bacteria to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition from no problems of <unk> <unk> and if it extends even more to windows.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a <unk> structure made of <unk> in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for <unk> objects in the sea, <unk> the <unk> life and placed on the ground, help grow a tree.
The fits for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we must dominate the bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> board, we did our own table of items, new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological <unk> within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these crops.
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the <unk> of fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
A light turns into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces biofuels useful for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, it would never be <unk>
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the tract tract is to help us <unk> these bacteria and to make their function on the way.
And so we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to the functionality in it.
If we wanted more photosynthesis, we had more transparent channels.
This <unk> digestive system when it stretches from one tip to another, it's 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football camp -- and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> brilliant channels with life within your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> creatures -- only half is <unk>
What if design is <unk> the other <unk>
What if we could create structures that increases <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the connective tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a form of edit biology.
I call this the material.
So you always have to go back to nature.
So for now, you know that a 3D printer built in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do it like this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly <unk> architecture -- a home within which they were <unk>
<unk> manufacturing is about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two protein in different <unk>
One acts as structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, which is the <unk> linking those fibers to each other.
And this is going through scales.
The silk worm first turned into the environment, creates a <unk> structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
<unk> and <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a magnet small to the head of a silk worm to <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of silk worm <unk>
However, by putting the silk worm in a flat patch -- not inside a box, we realized that they <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different parts of different parts -- and we've found that the shape, the composition, the structure of <unk> being transmitted directly through the environment.
They often <unk> silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that we saw that designing these templates can shape the <unk> silk without boiling a single <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we took this process to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot doing silk silk and we put us into our site.
We knew that silk worms are going to be in the darker and dark areas -- so we used a solar pathway to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light, and the heat of silk worms about structure.
We were prepared to get the <unk>
We asked <unk> silk silk <unk>
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to join us.
We put them carefully at the lower edge of the <unk> and while <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
By <unk> biological silk about silk <unk> <unk> give all of this pavilion to the integrity.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, <unk> silk <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the <unk>
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us, to form a <unk> ecology, designers must join these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new age of creation, that brings us into a design inspired in nature to a nature inspired by the very first time, which requires us for the first time, that we make care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked you what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time.
They can do it with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I am somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was not that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English -- the <unk> and the art and the art and making websites also playing the guitar in a rock band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And generally I like to test and persist anyway, because I have spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to move it up.
But then I looked at it for something else, something totally different, and I was going to stand in it, and I get to <unk> and I feel <unk> I've found the <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to move it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I was not sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denying all of my other passions, and I would call it to <unk>
Another reason that led to so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad in me for nothing.
I was worried about having a fear of engagement, or to be dispersed, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to ask you to have a couple of time.
They ask themselves, where do they learned to assign meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where the <unk> learned from culture.
We ask first question first. What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what I was going to do at that age.
It's considered a naive question to cause cute answers to children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
This question makes us over and over again as we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students, ask them to be asked in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's going to be the cute exercise of being the cute exercise of before it takes us sleep.
Why?
If this question is inspired by children to dream with what they might be, not inspires to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it does exactly the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, although adults are probably <unk> and say, "Oh, how nice, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  And he's a <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> a professor and <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that every one of us has something to spend during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and I devote your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What if there are many different themes that wake up their curiosity and lots of different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And there is something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> so I say.
It could help if you divide it in three parts: a potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms of terms with the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the time, the ideal was who was very well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or you like you or your own self.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as limitation or woe that you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas in my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in yield visualization of data, travel, math and design, as I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates the inspired <unk>
A <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by his mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
There are the new ideas.
And <unk> with all your background, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower superpower, is the very quick.
When we were <unk> we are interested in something, we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to be <unk> because it was a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid to test things and get out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring all of what we've learned to every new area that we have, so we rarely start from scratch.
<unk> <unk> is a full-time <unk> and <unk>
As a little girl, as a girl, he would have incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before becoming a writer, <unk> was a financial planner,
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when they started their thumb, and this ability helps you to write a compelling result for the editors.
<unk> time is a waste of time to get to what you would get to you, even if the end is going to be <unk>
Is it possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower superpower, is adaptability. So the ability to transform into anything you need in a given situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of music -- other website, sometimes consultant from Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because you can take various roles depending on the needs of your customers.
<unk> magazine defined adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can <unk> to meet the needs of the market needs -- which really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, fast learning -- three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could lose if you're a <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging people to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to address them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> from your belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams make up a doctor and a <unk> <unk>
<unk> can dive in depth and put ideas, and the <unk> offers a breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are going to do with the way we're wired.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a big part of them are <unk> to be more like their fellow <unk>
And once I said this, if there's one thing you can take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart doctor, then you go through all the media.
That's where you get the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those of you who just realized is one of them in the last 12 minutes --  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep his curiosity through those <unk> <unk>
<unk> intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring leads us to an authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year we went to a woman named <unk> they took a psychiatric in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
Her doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found strange plates and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
Even more amazing, even more surprising.
If you were to have been living today, we could not give her more help than what he was doing, he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has come a lot.
They have found antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> many treatments for cancer -- <unk> for HIV, and <unk> for the <unk> and much more.
But it's a little bit of progress in the treatment of Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million who, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live to 85 years or more, the chance of Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of the two.
In other words, there is the probability that they spend their years with Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or wanted to get Alzheimer's disease.
In the United States, Alzheimer's costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care spends on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and their costs -- a increase in five times in the year 2050, as the generation of the <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the largest medical challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be <unk> cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's percent of diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's percent despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what little people knows, but everybody is <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of all, scientists, the scientists, Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain in comparison with the case of Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to unleash severe memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's disease reduces the life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as a origami.
There are places in paper that are <unk>
And when it folds well, these <unk> dots end up in the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> points stay on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form great plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and your identification, what step block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
He would take a wire that could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that goes on, and then create a drug that is doing it.
Until recently, in its most part have been reduced by the wires and waiting for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, physical, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now you're testing a new kind of drugs that blocking specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'm going to show you some of our latest results.
No one outside of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see some videos of what happened to the test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick to each other inside of them, as in human Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms in a early stage, then we see that <unk> and living a normal life.
This is just a result of positive initial outcome, but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years, there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to beat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to convince you that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we get it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on government, industry, drug industry, and <unk>
That was essential to progress in HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the nonviolent victims of their loved ones day and night, are often too much <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimers is not in most cases a genetic disease.
All the world with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who cannot create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
This article in the <unk> column of the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The article is about a psychological study -- designed to create romantic love in the laboratory, and of my own experience to test it myself a night in the past.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers will be <unk> to be done by doing more personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would that be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you get it to someone else.
And <unk>
<unk> that are <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> <unk> actually <unk> me to your partner what you like from him or she was very honest with this time, and I gave things that you never would say to someone you have ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a little bit of detail really called me attention, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but, of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to be <unk>
But I thought it was a good story, and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the moral column of the course of a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you will probably ask some of you you probably are going to be still going together.
And the reason I think they challenge this is because I've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
One week before I was publishing the article he was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had encouraged me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog entry can get to a few hundreds of views as a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends, and I imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably have a few thousand views.
And that was a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as he had had no idea.
The article was published on a Friday night, and at Saturday morning, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I had called the <unk> "Today and Good <unk> <unk>
In one month, the article got over eight million pages, and I was, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with meaning about living experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called it or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they always were doing the same question: still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages showed up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and journalists like this.
I was interviewed in radio and <unk>
I even gave a talk, and a woman yelled up to the stage, "Hey "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got a red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to sit comfortable with it.
But I was not prepared for the <unk>
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> your life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article for Saint <unk> who included the experiences of readers when we test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first urge to all of this attention was to be very close to my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public onset together.
I read television interviews, and he refused for pictures of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the auditory icons of the process of <unk> a range for which I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know if the studio worked, they wanted to know if I really <unk> I mean, if it was capable of producing love <unk> not just a <unk> but love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel like to respond.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, especially that people asked the wrong question.
How do you know if they were going together or not, and then <unk>
If the answer was not, I would do the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead I was looking for <unk> <unk> among college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants felt more close to doing it, several <unk> studies were also used <unk> protocol <unk> as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community. And they've used it among people of the opposite of the opposite of the <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and said to me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed to be <unk> by it.
And I said, Do you want to say that you would tell you about the person with whom I read it.
Well he made a break.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, but got better friends?
<unk> they were able to get better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So I said, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it's about love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29 and was going through a really difficult separation to me.
I had had that relationship since I was 20, what I was supposed to do was almost all my adult life, and he was my first true love and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I was interested in science.
And I did all of what I was able to find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could be <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I was just researching the book that I was writing but in retrospect, it looks really <unk>
I thought that if I approached the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and used as I sat then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one or another way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I'm after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably that they can demand me.
What I'm looking for love is an <unk> not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to remain <unk> by the person I love.
It can be that this is the guarantee that people ask when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media said about 36 questions is that there might be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some <unk> risk, and this is a very <unk> story, because they love us to feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it's about love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The version of the story is, they still follow together?
And their content with a response response, or No.
So more than a question, I would propose that we make more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who not?
How do you stay in love with the things when things were <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live in the uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how you live with the doubt of your partner?
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the brief version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year, a known one, and I apply a study designed to create romantic love, we are still following us together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love they're not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my paper <unk> The love didn't happen.
<unk> fallen in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit when I read it now, not because it's not true, but in the moment, I had not thought of everything that was supposed to be that choice.
I didn't think it was how many times we would have to make that decision, and how much times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he will always choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded by 36 questions, I have chosen to love someone as generous, kind of fun and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't think of truth.
And what I think about, and what maybe spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending at the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love somebody, and the hope that he also loved to love, and it's a scary one, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some lesbian <unk> and in a way, I got a <unk> of the forest.
The New York City ago, a time ago,  -- something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and <unk> a <unk> bill a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some of the strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment because I was in <unk> <unk> I like to go from tour and do <unk> and all of those things, and I was doing a <unk> for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style Agnes Martin, I wrapped up the <unk> and a bee got <unk>
Well, my mother is really afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more <unk> on the canvas, thinking I could do it.
Instead, it happened the opposite: somehow it seemed to grow a size of size, as if you were to get the text with a <unk>
So I did. I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, these strange bottles that I was finding around the street, all I could find, because I was looking for all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
I can be able to draw the same as you draw around a body in the crime scene.
And I took the objects and I created my own taxonomy of specimens from <unk>
First of all, they will be able to get an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was gaining some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, go to <unk>
It was great, man.
At some point I got interested in the human form, <unk> sculptures of <unk> of human beings with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing in the glass sheets, similar to the drawing of a window, and then on another window, and it had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition that formed a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work was going on with something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by <unk> in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of the <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
It's 30 feet long.
It has double <unk> so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with the heads of animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of <unk> to this <unk> mesh of the <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
This is where the creatures with animals are headed to <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform.
We also have a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in one hand while the other hand comes out of clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of the <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand in which we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, it has a <unk> like a bird <unk> and spits clouds out of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> a <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail hit the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go out you know.
His tail ends up in a balloon balloon made out of terrorist cards.
They have <unk>
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of the terrorists.
It brings me to my latest project.
I'm in two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a <unk> project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material are <unk> dictionaries.
But each one acts as a kind of file in a way of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They are like cells, they come together, they <unk>
And you can walk between them. I'm getting a few years old.
Each one is basically a <unk> of microscope that weighs 1.3 kilogram pounds with a human <unk> inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest <unk>
I'm going to show you for the rest of the body -- there is a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and he covers the penis or the <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick view of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a <unk> body in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and enter the head of this strange statue itself.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> <unk> It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a writer, a <unk> a school, a school, an editorial arm that spreads all the content we do in the world; and a garden.
And we got the box and all of the people in <unk> with others like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you think about it and the box in which it's living on.
And together we came to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, of borders, it doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill to have any effect on pain, first about the stomach, the guts and other organs.
And I'll take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug will be <unk> in the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When they take drugs -- these are <unk> to decrease the amount of viruses in blood, and increase the plant of cells.
But they are also known for their side side effects, in most negative -- because in the time that it takes to get to the current body, <unk> and worse even for the time that it takes to get to their destiny, which is where it's more important, in the waste pollution.
These are the regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the solar system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood stream of patients that are going to be <unk> to regulate antiretroviral drugs.
However, behind the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of life that is <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> to get the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me: <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for care of wounds and surgery surgery, you can be used for anything <unk> including transportation transportation.
In fact, we're already using pulses of laser to open or drill extremely small holes that open and close and close and close with the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people are asked, "What is that <unk>
And we sent a little laser beam laser on the cellular membrane living in HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, as the cell absorbs the drug into a matter of <unk>
Before you even noticed, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology to the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll make a <unk> in the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it goes to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes it, it releases it directly on the site of infection, as the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if he's successful, this technology can lead to total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every researcher in the <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I have studied armed groups, not <unk> organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups are when they're not shooting at them.
My goal is to understand better to these intensive care agents and study ways of encouraging violent participation to violent <unk>
I do work in field, in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups are key to solving almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be an argument between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and actors.
For example, of the <unk> peacekeeping agreements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had been signed up with a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even need to be <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they are doing it, but nobody looks at what they do when they didn't want to.
The armed struggle and political struggle are <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global picture.
The armed groups of today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for their violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party, a network of social services and a military system.
Similarly, the Palestinian Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide suicide attacks in Israel, also runs <unk> in Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
Are they multitasking
We were able to make a complex machine from <unk> radio channels, TV channels, web websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the print magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups also invest in a complex fundraising fund but through <unk> business -- for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, running hospitals, they put in a professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
<unk> groups also try to conquer the population by offering us something that has no security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan ran by war or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also be able to look at the efforts of these groups for delivering safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a higher price for the population.
But in general, providing social services to fill a vacuum, a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006 from Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill gaps around the government, and they emerge as armed and political groups, they participate in the violent struggle and governance.
And the more sophisticated and sophisticated ones are these organizations, we can see it as a bit of a state.
How would you call a group like <unk>
They were part of a territory, running all of their functions, collect the trash, run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without state and hybrids and the more <unk> the states are states, like in the Middle East and <unk> that gap.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups are going to have to invest more in no military tools.
<unk> that gap of government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put peace.
If we understand better groups that we will understand better than incentives to foster the transition from violence to nonviolent violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, the military power, but we won't give us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that safety of security, and to fill that governance gap that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but fear that are openly the label tag would be unfair for the <unk>
I'm a feminist, but quite bad.
And so I think of it as a bad feminist.
Or, at least I wrote a paper, and a book called "The bad <unk> and then in interviews, people started calling me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> sex.
Today, I see how women are treated and women around the world and anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the people to <unk> who might be a feminist.
It will be labeled a feminist was a <unk> and a bad word.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who ask too much with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until he realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I began to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also, proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same paycheck for the same work.
We have the right to travel around the world as <unk> free or violence.
We have a right to use it to use easy and accessible to the contraceptives and the <unk> services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without the need for <unk> or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to realize our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition and skills and more.
We need to have to have these differences and how we can tell ourselves the same way that it matters in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is not nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of <unk>
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I hear music rap to all volume.
Even though the letter degrades women and encouraged me: the classic <unk> classic <unk> of the yin <unk> <unk> is incredible.
Do you actually get your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical desires.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> tasks, but also killing insects, the <unk> of the grass and the maintenance maintenance and <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink color is my favorite color.
<unk> from the fashion magazines and the nice stuff.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the fairy fairy <unk>
Some of my actions are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it's her choice, and I'm not who to <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their kids, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that women are economically vulnerable when they were born.
So let's get this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism has been ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women of color, gay workers, gay and <unk> for women and <unk> and high class and high.
<unk> if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist feminist guy.
It also happens to the following: How do I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this trend of <unk> <unk> <unk>
We hope that they will bring perfect ones.
When we get rid of <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider myself to be <unk> before you try to put me there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders of sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They have a fear of standing up and say, "Yes, I'm a fear of fear that it means that that tag is a fear of fear not being able to be able to do with a little realistic expectations of realistic.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years a feminist <unk>
In the Video: Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> of three feet tall.
It was a show of <unk> to see this star star embracing openly feminism and to know women and young men who become a feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics started a endless argument if they were <unk> or not just a feminist.
I would take their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection from <unk> because we're still fighting a lot, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We're going to go much beyond the sane and constructive for <unk> feminism for any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or rather, a more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to the day, will go to action and be a little <unk>
If I listen to music, <unk> I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to give a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they make the change affecting it to actually affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why has their music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions do this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equal equality we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think about three and four years old.
They are two <unk> <unk> <unk> and bright and <unk> I want you to grow in a world.
They were <unk> by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option will be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sexual violence against women like sports -- <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change radio radio when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies don't treat women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting the professional sports where athletes treat their fellow as <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in his magazine, participate in his project, or work with you, until I don't have a number enough number of women, so much to participate in the way to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but they were willing to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also engage them to be despite the way that we are going to be pushed away from the barriers to the decision partner.
We are not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and hope that our decisions get to the top, to the people in which directors and movie producers and music, <unk> <unk> people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a lasting and significant.
We can also claim for bravery our feminism, -- well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> a bad feminist is not to be <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I say, most of all, because my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A little bit of a young guys told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe it wasn't nothing.
I think of my voice, and after everything I didn't help me to believe something that might matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was going to focus on a stronger version of myself.
The words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me, and they understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and I've also discovered that if I was a little brave one, another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is nothing that the world is trying to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I hold the <unk> reality, that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way of thinking, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little bit courageous, when you need a bit of such <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> because of being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things of this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be lousy for a child with a immune system, is one of the most easily preserved diseases in the world.
There is a effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the outbreak -- they didn't have been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> the autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and vaccines were disqualified and marked by being a fraud <unk> by the British Medical Medical <unk>
It doesn't believe the most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know it, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will put in danger to their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism in the time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and <unk> that I had heard about it creates all their professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates continued to stable only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> of fundraising like <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as if it could be <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Center for Disease Control Disease Control what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic diagnosis, and a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for in the face of his son two years, visual contact face.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be <unk> why were they so <unk> at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened to have less to do with the slow progress and <unk> of the science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a doctor's psychiatrist with a child psychiatrist -- Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
They could have fun for hours by waving their hands to their faces, but they were prey of panic by <unk> as when he wasn't put into their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
Over the base of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the years of 1950, as the main authority of the world in the subject, stated that I had seen less than 150 cases of their syndrome while <unk> references from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria for <unk> for diagnosis of autism were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was <unk> that he had become nine from 10 children sent by other doctors to her office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of chronic psychosis.
These kids, he said, they have kept you carefully in a refrigerator that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, however, I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could tell between 18 kilometers before I turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he properly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, claiming things like the children were simply <unk> what they had heard their parents were willing to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started to test the theory of <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought the theory of mothers who were <unk> <unk> was quite stupid.
She and her husband and husband were warm and <unk> and they had a very profound autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as black-eyed <unk> without special education, no special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and his colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
<unk> a study of prevalence in the general population.
<unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse and diverse reality.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or <unk> of <unk>
In other ways, these children didn't fit in small frames and <unk> as they said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did nobody have no <unk> of these children before?
But then I <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and that then <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but it avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation to the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> talked German, and he was <unk> for her.
The document offers a alternative story of autism.
His author was a guy named Hans <unk> who ran a <unk> clinic with a school school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for <unk> standards.
The morning in the clinic started with lessons with music, and kids kept their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's as a <unk> disability of life that required <unk> <unk> and <unk> spaces over the course of life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, Asperger's would call them their little teachers, and he started to help the developing methods of education that were especially appropriate for them.
<unk> Asperger's is seen autism as a diverse continuum that holds a surprising variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common, and they have always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in architectural <unk> as the awkward social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith discovered that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
In the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to extend the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the late '80s, and early '90s, their changes came into <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a broad and inclusive.
These changes don't fell in <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked together to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before it came out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, only a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and the <unk> recognition, <unk> with four awards on <unk> <unk> psychologists, psychologists, and parents all knew what the autism was.
At the same time, when the first clinical clinics were introduced to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes at the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they were hoping that they were trying to get the people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and the services that were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to the vaccines for the increase in the <unk> and a simple, powerful, powerful, credible <unk> <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the center of prevention that one of the 68 children in America are in the spectrum, is right, the autistic ones are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, people are autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles for solving the new technological advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work, doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards -- the normal human brain is easily <unk> social, <unk> and it suffers from a attention to the details.
Certainly autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which believed that the <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, support communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on deck to <unk> the ship of <unk>
As we go into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to afford a brain or a brain.
Thank you.
