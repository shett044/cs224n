You know what I do is write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children for the United States.
And I always tell people I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> as farmer, or with leather clothes, and nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that one epiphany is usually something that fell into a place.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the years in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of class.
So when I was beating up to bleeding every week in the bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life to let me go into the bathroom room in the teachers.
I did it in secret.
for three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years, I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, at the middle of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm guessing that adults never get to know us.
You could <unk> <unk> and please bring that guy that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to stand up with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we were <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found it a place, the <unk> and the monitored and they took away from his family, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman I wanted to <unk> as adult came to <unk> became a box of cinders and was put on my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I was saving it.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs real and beauty, and I'm very happy that I today talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our job to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was amazed.
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I put them down to me around the water -- almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even even more think that it was a <unk> about another <unk> as a year.
<unk> are born when they fall from the glaciers or the ice booms are born.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to give up and hold them up to the end, while others cannot be <unk> and <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> who are isolated on top of us, in large as we see ourselves as a human being.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> I'm breathing your ancestral atmosphere.
As you melts a iceberg, it releases fresh water into minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestry, knowing that in these unique moments there are that way and won't exist in that way again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of their way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> that photography is very <unk> it's a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last few pictures I'd like to show you are from a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to actually get to witness a <unk> <unk>
Here's it.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an <unk> iceberg <unk>
<unk> out of the water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of your personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same moment, every single person -- a baby. Okay.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to be too much at the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about the conception of the conception of it, I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in an case, the chromosome -- and the sperm is joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome from sperm joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my land activity to come up with two roles.
In one of my roles work with the history of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people are doing the anatomy -- that -- of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body fluids.
The other role that performance is in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients, or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with twins <unk> two people inside one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people who are much lower than the average.
And I've been working with many cases of people with <unk> sex -- individuals whose physical <unk> doesn't fit into male <unk> and conventional female <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples in ways of having a sex that doesn't fit in the naked forms of male or female.
For example, the case is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> gene from the chromosome -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that will become <unk>
And then, in life we <unk> the testes produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's the <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high levels of testosterone but <unk>
As a result, the body develops on a <unk> course <unk>
When you look at the baby <unk>
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing breast -- but it doesn't have the menstrual period when someone realizes that something is going on.
After doing tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and an Y.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like this.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called <unk> glands
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a woman who doesn't know their structure -- I think it's a typical woman -- most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We're producing <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> syndrome.
That's why sex is a complicated thing, it's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old boy born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sexual relations with her, he was wearing a life as a guy and just found out that he had <unk> and a <unk>
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had 20th chromosomes and the uterus -- the glands <unk> were so active that, in essence, created a male environment.
As a consequence, the genitals were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormone component typically the male component are made.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> nothing.
And it was at the 19 years when he started having medical problems that was caused by internal <unk> when doctors figured out that, in fact, was a woman in the inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> -- that they have <unk> tissue wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why it happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies -- I mean, are <unk> twins, or <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is not to be able to get rid of a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why <unk> several surgeries is that they're a threat for our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy is <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity -- <unk> to be black means to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with the <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the very romantic <unk>
Imagine how amazing it is to have children that are born like two people in one body.
The most higher case is last year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> his sex in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Many journalists called to wonder: "What test are you going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that there is no such one.
In fact, we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women or <unk> and women and <unk> are us who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more progress goes through science, we have to admit that these categories were <unk> <unk> categories that are directly <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> are much more <unk> than <unk>
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go on a really rough terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we think about science we get more and more in a awkward area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too much <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today, not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors had never had to do it with this question of if someone was dead.
As a lot of you put up a pen in front of the nose, and if they still didn't do it.
If I stopped moving it out.
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we need to deal with dilemma to actually determine somebody's death -- and this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the actual categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories might be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, to people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that makes me nervous.
<unk> these categories are much more fragile than we thought we were <unk>
<unk> from the point of view of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension -- I first have to admit that I'm a <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I find myself all so much watching that music <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
That's why it happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> were, for me, the first activists of anatomy and explain them why.
What they were doing was a <unk> concept and <unk> it with another which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what our <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right to birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was coming to the law of the blood right from the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
The <unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it by a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They put up the game of play and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> that was very radical.
And in part they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time was <unk> science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the story of <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be transmitted by a <unk> idea of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence and talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And it was a consequence of the consequence of the <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future Civil Rights movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women.
Then came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the lines of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color who are going to go to <unk> <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at each other, we need to start asking why we maintain certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights to a human.
I don't want to say that we had to go to anatomy.
I don't want to say that the five years of five years should be allowed to have sexual activity, or married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two sentient beings at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before a time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, was born on term, was born on March 1, 1980.
For the only fact that I had been born three months before Mary are attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- to the right to the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it's born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from the embarrassment of the Mary that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, for your part, doesn't have the same rights that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can be married in every states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So we still <unk> categories that are in various aspects are <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is, what do we do now that science is going on so much in the field of anatomy that we arrive at the point of having to admit that a democracy based in the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like the science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we need to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example: Texas at a certain point has decided to marry a man -- you don't have to have a chromosome -- and that to marry a woman you've got to have an Y.
Now, in the practice they don't do a test test for people.
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you to the beginning of <unk> syndrome.
If we look at one of the founders of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I am <unk> to <unk> it provides a solution.
It says we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks very good."
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be able to focus on this for <unk> rights to people, because I've been trying to admit that I know about some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some of the <unk> that I know can make you more <unk> smart decisions that people from 40 I know.
So how do you put the theme of the content of <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current business of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels to be attracted to other men is susceptible to <unk> unless you're willing to have a care of sex, in which case it allows you to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the surgeon that I talked about a couple years ago that I had done a couple years ago that I had done <unk> identical <unk> to then pick up his fame.
But when the phone asked her the reason for the <unk> <unk> a very <unk> operation -- he said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and so I had to do it.
And I said, "Well, he considered the political mathematician, rather than the separation <unk>
America offers huge possibilities to people to be who who are the people who are <unk> to change the state of the state.
So I think we need to be on your head.
Well, to end up I mean I have been talking about the <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be like or as it might have been, if we were given more participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a bit of radical for a feminist, and it's that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about a group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of how to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and care about those who are <unk> inside the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in the movies, one of my advisers I knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I considered a feminist, as a <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with rid of the <unk> of gender, so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I think the more I thought about the question, it has seemed like there is something women in <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships to help the most vulnerable.
So if you were <unk> they were very aware of the way to protect people from the state, it's possible to be able to be able to put more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we find democracy beyond the <unk> to think less in the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more in the relationships.
So as we tried to create a perfect <unk> we think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where to go to live and work, have the chance to choose between at least a bunch of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now we are far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth much more than their building cost.
So we could easily go to the world -- perhaps hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you have never thought about new cities.
But it just removes by buildings in apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments are already owners and to the other half to get it to do it.
You could try to increase the ability to make <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and areas that surround them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the building distractions in the building of construction.
So it would be very hard to do all of those <unk>
But you could go to a totally new place, build a whole new apartment building, and as long as the rules of that <unk> <unk> construction instead of <unk>
So I proposed that the governments will build new reform zones to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
Later I found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of truly Honduras.
They knew that every year about 75 <unk> they will come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> I went through a constitutional crisis.
In the following elections -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform where they <unk> <unk> and the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his chief <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of standards, like those rules that say they cannot go and sustain all the current residents in apartments.
<unk> a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes both of technologies like the norms for <unk> and usually they are the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala was sent to <unk> a link with the <unk>
He showed him to <unk>
They call.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities are, much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York <unk> land that, in some cases, for thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion, and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk was described in very simple terms, that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and a choice so that people can choose whether they want to go or live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> I called, and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way for our country to move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport covers over 100 kilometers square.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that would be <unk> at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
All the world's <unk> world.
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained <unk> that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that might be able to go in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away to the North.
And we also have new choices for leaders.
Because the U.S. government leaders would need help from <unk> countries, they could benefit from the countries associated with these countries that will help them build and make the norms of the <unk> so that they could all be able to trust the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could only be a thousand square miles.
And shortly later, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> his Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow us to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis, the voting in Congress for this constitutional constitutional was from <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the values in society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17th, February went over again in a voting -- <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting from 21 to 24 of February, a shifting of about 30 <unk> was to the two places in the world that are more interested in participating in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center of the city that is building in Korea in Korea is bigger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years after they spent four years getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and are preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical mode, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the managers to be able to be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow its Supreme Court to be the last instance for this new criminal system.
There are urban <unk> and cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that we have solved is that they have a good number of residents.
There are many companies that want to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would want to change the other place.
There are one million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
A lot of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to get a job -- sometimes they're unwed mothers who have to win the money for just eating or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it seem to think about <unk> so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friend <unk> asked me to say, "Thank TED TED.
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what's inside the inside, I'm going to make a confession -- and you know, I live with the <unk>
I love to find a little bit more recently, to photograph and publish my blog suits and <unk> and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is second hand of <unk> markets and <unk>
Oh, thank you.
<unk> stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to know <unk> people -- usually my money is going to a good <unk> -- my aspect is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
Is it my <unk>
Do you like <unk>
Less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was doing for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I'm suit.
I've brought seven pairs of underwear, and nothing else.
<unk> inside for exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I'd like to use after you got to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman walking at TED in underwear,  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that I was like, or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start on Sunday.
This is what I call a brilliant tiger do.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look at it.
You almost always see you phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All of the <unk> including <unk> it took me up, and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> color is power.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people happy.
<unk> the integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
Just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- you don't just give you <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the boy who are coming in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember her <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you do well with something, it's almost safe than you are.
And if you think you don't look well with something, probably it's true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years I really understood his meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, there is no look that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to accomplish everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> Really six words for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style and only a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried over and over again, when people came up with this week, just by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is obviously not going into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson that I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to go back certain things.
I don't need <unk> <unk> to these things, because back in the corner, there will always be another <unk> colorful <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logical part, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be a completely logical.
This would be a totally intuitive.
So, where is your brain at this scale?
Some of them would be able to take away from one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something that -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, as well as most of the other quantum physicists, <unk> we need a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We're going to play with them and then we see like <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
<unk> intuition that you may have developed with the age of the years is the one that says that one thing can be only in a place at once.
I mean, it might sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a child playing in a <unk> bar.
It was a small child, and he didn't do it very well, they always <unk>
But I bet that play with that bar in a parking bar and taught a valuable lesson, and that is that the big things don't allow the <unk> and they stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for particle particles, because they don't play with parking spaces, play with these weird little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover they do all kinds of things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the quantum mechanics.
At that point it was the physics of a few years -- you need from quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need it to describe the big objects that surround us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, he never saw a <unk>
But I also didn't fit my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of <unk>
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't be.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that it's been in a overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the piece of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's right at the center.
And then here we do a very good approach to the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of metal, with a springboard and that <unk> <unk> on a platform.
And so I did this almost the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a chip of silicon again, and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this <unk> <unk> which is underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for it needs a little bit of aid.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird, but then when other people come up and do those things, because I don't want them to <unk> or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The journey of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that <unk> it and the wind that happens to its side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then we introduced a <unk> and pulled out all the air -- and then we would turn it into a temperature of less than a degree by absolute zero.
Now, by being in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act as you like.
So we measure their movement.
We found that moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was vibrating. And the way they were <unk> it was like a breath of this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving you a soft thing, we were able to make it <unk> and that they didn't get to the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean is that one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they are <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
It's true.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on the scale between one atom and that little bit of metal is more or less the same little difference between that little bit of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my part of the logic of speech.
So imagine if you were in a number of places at the same time, how would you be that?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we turned it, and we turned the lights and look inside the box, we saw the metal still in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, seemingly all the objects on the elevator actually are only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections all around the things that you literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another work at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that is here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and so.
A lot of negotiations and stories, was <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is just explaining to just this slide and this slide is access.
I grew up in India.
It was a great education -- I didn't care about, but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, started to learn a lot.
And working at Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So better that shows the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've done from his launch.
So, let's go to <unk>
Look around all the museums who are there.
There's the gallery gallery -- the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to get into one of my favorites, in <unk> the art of New York City.
There are two ways of doing it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and they <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the top, and with one click click on it.
They're inside, that you want to go at the end of the hall,
They continue to go.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign there.
If the museum shows the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click right here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million <unk>
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get from 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million <unk>
You can zoom in something very straightforward.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression doesn't have a price.
But if you really want to get to <unk>
So I started to play, and I found myself with something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
And I came out and discovered that children were actually playing something.
And I had a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick on the Tuesday line.
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper and deeper and you'll see that you can actually get the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take you the image, so you'll really see what's there.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, for a second.
So now we're rapidly going to jump at MoMA in New York City.
Here's another one of my favorite <unk>
The example I showed was to find a details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It goes up and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts of this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot more things here, but I don't have any time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely all, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online to create their own museum, create their own collection of all these images.
It's very simple, we walked in, I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just ran around.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even they don't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium makes justice to your artwork and that is actually represented properly online.
And the big question that I'm doing today is, "You do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I've got something to show you.
So think it's a <unk> a <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm an Italian, all the kids in Italy grow up with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something very interesting on <unk> <unk> one in the last two decades.
A long time ago, if you wanted to win a <unk> career, one would take a budget and give it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the race.
So this is what in engineering, we have <unk> control system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What is interesting today is that the control systems in real time are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're getting computers into the free air.
And, like <unk> they're starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex on the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond the cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> Uncle <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's as if almost all the existing atoms are going to become sensors and <unk>
And that is completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of <unk> <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end, he took the hammer and he threw it back to the Moses -- that you can still see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and he said, <unk> <unk> -- and he said, <unk> <unk> -- and he said, <unk> <unk> -- and he said, <unk> <unk> -- and he said, <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a little bit of <unk> insisting on the idea of taking the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is really one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer since 2006.
It was the year where Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of remember, they were playing Italy and France, and at the end, <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, the end won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day looking at the activity in the web.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning before the game.
The line of time is at the top.
In the late afternoon, there are people here and there are <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a quick call and go to the bathroom.
Second time End of time.
First of course, a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
<unk> Italy, yeah!
That night everyone went to <unk> at the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day everyone went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then the whole world is <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time <unk> people are going to <unk> it is a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and we consume it.
Today, we know everything about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a <unk> how it <unk>
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project we developed some small tags to track the trash in their shift through the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are going to happen.
Then we put them a little chip, one tag on the garbage and then we started to <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there's a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist yet.
There are complicated things happening and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing we think we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that <unk> doesn't disappears, which is still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle you're going to leave one day still is still there.
That if we showed that to people, then we can make some change change change.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part of talking to the beginning, which is <unk> about the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop, was, imagine that you have a <unk> and <unk> valves <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It creates like a curtain. of water, with pixels of water.
If the pixels go to you, you can write in them, show patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will be opening up so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And <unk> a commission to design the entrance to the <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There are no doors or windows, but when you move to it open to you just to get it out.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there is a little wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> the ceiling.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this case.
So those days, there will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it goes down almost all the architecture gone.
Here it is working.
You see the people who are going on with what happens in it.
And here I'm myself trying to do not <unk> by testing the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working out.
That night was actually more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way they interact with the way it had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to you to let you happen, but a building that was still doing <unk> and holes of water and you had to jump up to get wet.
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about how people will give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels and the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine you could have little helicopters in the air, and every one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw earlier, that moves with others in sync.
Could we form this cloud, this cloud.
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, what it changes is light, not the position of the <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen would appear in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And that then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D, where you can get close, and <unk> and see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to a <unk> as it was before.
When you turn the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, from the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best zoning dancers of today, the star of the New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture its 3D movements and use it as input to the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> it captures it in different <unk>
It's so <unk> in real time as a movement capture.
You can <unk> all the movement.
You can go through the way.
And once we have pixels with them, we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is to imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment like a <unk> farm like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make all of them just a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last couple of years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can move from the digital world of the <unk> power of networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to go from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with <unk>
You can move through the inside, having different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, serve to share the main moments of 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a connection to the community.
So it's a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can get into there.
As if it was a new <unk> in the night, but the most important thing is that being a new experience for anyone to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just some changes in your genes, they could improve the <unk> for more accurate and faster.
Or you might want to be in a better way, to be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and sure about ourselves?
What about living more with good health?
Or maybe be those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else would you do?
What would you like, if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
How much people do creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably had the number of creative people.
That's very good.
How many do you want <unk>
A few more.
And the <unk> state.
<unk>
How about <unk>
Oh, most people, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world that would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference but today I want to give you a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which was also <unk> in the <unk> Church, he wrote a trial titled <unk> in biology makes sense except to the light of <unk>
But if you effectively accept biological evolution to consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
It refers to others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well in one end, is, of course, the most people that interest us.
<unk> of a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There have been maybe 20 or 25 percent different species of <unk>
Some of them have been and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we are very far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> that comes out of <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on the gut more bacteria than the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, when Antonio <unk> asks you about the <unk> you think about the <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, dark <unk> it's very <unk>
And we're going to give you all the nutrients that you can want to make effort on their part.
It really is like a quick way for the bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush <unk>
But so we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us of certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or it meant to become something different, something maybe better adapted to <unk>
In this vast symphony <unk> of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and only only <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope that you've got it <unk>
When I first went to college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, every cell is just <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters cells.
But when organisms appear. things start to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important: with the emergence of sexual reproduction that the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of death of the body comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to confess that when I was a college student thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death for <unk> it seemed quite reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every time I was more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still happened in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits your hotel table.
He opens the door.
In front of him is a magnificent <unk> <unk>
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
She said, "Well, says, George, says, "I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different aim for the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to get healthy.
I wanted to get health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is about changing the genome to the next <unk> adapted and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let them fall into the sea.
I think that all of us -- the feeling that put Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily replace longevity.
It doesn't necessarily replace the biggest or the stronger or the faster and the faster and even even the smartest of the smarter.
Evolution benefits the best creatures adapted to their environment.
That's the only test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish -- the <unk> yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's going on in evolution and if we come back to think of the human beings in evolution and, in particular, if we look forward to phase <unk> I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying thinking would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and cut from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment for us to get to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> us so much that it is no longer possible to have the isolation that we need to happen.
A second possibility is that we produce a evolution of the traditional type, that is affecting the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when we kind of <unk> distant planets are going to exist and the environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there is a third possibility, a possibility -- intriguing and scary.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals that are <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
So let's first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society but it's what you choose to individual and family and familiar.
Think also that if it could be possible to be able to choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in your own body to make genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could do the genetic changes to get diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminating the <unk>
Would you not want to do those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project began in 1990 and sued 13.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of being finished, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost close to the 20,000 and a week.
Not too much to make the human genome -- and it's going to be more and more of all of us all.
Are those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to be set to herd immunity.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in course with the flu flu -- in a plant plant cells.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then only two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells of your <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newly <unk> egg and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, cutting out the diabetes, to reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases that are going to allow us to use <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of <unk> <unk> especially if you could get it to the next generation of machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle faster than allow us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions of spending this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to develop the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years and we can give it to 1,000 years and maybe happened within the next 100 years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to them.
We're going to use these choices for a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or are we going to be able to selectively selectively attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more <unk> or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deeper thing about all: we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and <unk> the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what could be done, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds frightening.
Well, I had a single seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one that I could talk to the <unk> workers.
So immediately, I looked at them, and they said, "No problem -- probably <unk> some <unk>
The pilot had already taken off the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not <unk>
<unk> the motors.
Imagine being on a plane and without some noises.
And then he said three words.
The three more <unk> words I'd ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people who wanted to come and I didn't did, all the fences that I wanted to use, all the experiences I've wanted to have and never <unk>
While I was thinking about that, I came up with a sentence, which is <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'll open.
I don't want to miss anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is while we were <unk> the bridge George Washington, which was not a lot -- I thought about, "I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to get better on everything I did.
But in my humanity also gives rise to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I think about things that didn't care about people who matter.
And I thought about my wife with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have <unk> <unk> being <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And while I <unk> I had the feeling of, <unk> die is not scary.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to myself, I love my life.
And that sadness will become a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- the first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --  --  And I scream, <unk> like a little.
And for me, that was all reason to be in the world.
At that point I understood that two points -- that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal that I have in life is to be a good father.
I was awarded a miracle, not to die that day.
And it was gave me another gift, which was the chance of looking at the future and will live in another way.
You are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens to you in your plane -- and please not be -- but you can imagine, and how do you go?
What is it that they are still expecting to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would they change their relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents that we have.
Thank you.
I've recently been <unk> in life with many different projects.
But the most great thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the '80s.
One day he came to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today <unk> has total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design firm and animation so obviously graffiti is a little intricate that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with her brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that he <unk> he saw Stephen <unk> it's not that all people with paralysis can communicate by those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're an important person and you have a good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Did anybody see the film <unk> and <unk>
They communicate in that way, and they go <unk> with the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I introduced me to the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of doing a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I slept with his brother and her father there at this very moment, <unk> well, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make their art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much in your interior can't be <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research -- which have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser laser, draw on that and register the negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
First, they start with sex organs, then with the bad words, then with the Bush attacks, and in the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of moving things from one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the doors of insurance companies and we got a machine that could be able to make a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing that we did was bring seven programmers from all over the world -- from every single corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the children and I, we moved to the garage back and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> and they took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we were doing something totally stupid and that when they were <unk> they would have taken off the walls of the walls and in their place, would have <unk>
But for two weeks -- we went to the <unk> walk of <unk> my son was part of my dog as well, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of cheap sun glasses that we bought in the <unk> <unk> <unk> which was some copper wire and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We took a <unk> camera, the <unk> we put it on an LED light and now there's a device that is free -- and it builds one <unk> we published the software <unk> the software goes down.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no insurance company to say, "No."
There are no hospital that I can say, "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate by just their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we came back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after over a planning year, two weeks of success of all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life, and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot outside the hospital.
And he came back to draw for the first time in his family and friends -- and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what was saying, "This was the first time he drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody finally came to <unk> and they would get me out there so that I could <unk>
Isn't it wonderful?
In a certain way, that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to fix it and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
Everything comes from our own pockets.
The prizes were <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then in December, Time magazine told us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, and it was really great.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up to close the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be in the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, do it possible.
None of what there was in this room was possible -- the computer -- the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at the time.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> technology -- I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find something that we feel like to do, if it's not now, otherwise, if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations usually very difficult and at the same time as dangerous as possible.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine, dangerous.
<unk> in <unk> <unk> and dangerous areas.
And I spent 30 days to eating only this -- fun at first, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I've been thinking about it in situations where the only goal to treat.
So when I knew that I would come here to make a TEDTalk about the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard of, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some of Twitter, I offered the rights to the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What it was there was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is to do, and the content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it to you or your company to do it.
But I said this is a very good chance to do this.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I hadn't had to tell you about certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working, we looked at the world of marketing, from advertising.
And as I said earlier, I've been involved in horrible situations over the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> nothing could be <unk> for something that hard or as dangerous as I can go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that is about <unk> <unk> marketing and advertising, -- and that the whole film was <unk> with <unk> and marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The <unk> <unk>
What happens in "The <unk> movie has ever been <unk> is that everything at the bottom below, it has pictures of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title, the X-rays.
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> by <unk> forever.
And so the film is looking at this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is what? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk>
He was <unk> <unk>
But we're not only going to have the sponsors of the X mark, in the title, but we're going to make sure that we would take all the categories that we could on the film.
Maybe we had a shoe and it becomes the most cool shoe that you've got to.
The most great car that you carry in the greatest film ever <unk> the best drink that you <unk> <unk> from "The largest movie ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then to show you the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> make the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is transparency.
You'll see all the process in this movie.
That's the complete idea, all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help us help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the ultimate respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how responsive is going to be people to it.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> No <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half <unk> <unk> <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult to meeting, but it's certainly going to be worth convincing a couple of big ones.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out and look at us as a lot of <unk>
MS: What's going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be available.
MS: But it's going to be hard for the film to be I?
JK: Both things.
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So, I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people who have to be <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought that <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so, one for one, all of these companies suddenly disappeared.
None wanted to have anything to do with this movie.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to present the product as many people as possible, to make so many people saw it as possible.
Especially in the world today -- this intersection of new media and old media and the landscape of the separate media, is not the idea to have that new vehicle worth of attention that it's going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had a mistake <unk> and that mistake was this.
Actually no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this picture.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that shows up.
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> free of simulation or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line perhaps the largest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our <unk> <unk> President <unk> even <unk> <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make it really changes it changes.
But why? Well, transparency da <unk>  like that weird bear that still follows <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird, rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell you that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to take a story, but you want to say <unk> <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in some lie -- and there is he looked at me, like, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and there's the <unk> story.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that was just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> from many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take the companies and go to the companies I do with all my team.
So what I started to figure out is a sudden -- and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, big, big, giant huge, and others who make small, independent films like mine.
And my friends who make a movie of the <unk> <unk> they say that the reason why their movies have so successful is due to the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The <unk> <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to leave, every time I open up my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say "Are you cool for this <unk>
Are you ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there's one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have both for man as a solid, <unk> to <unk> <unk>
That's the big look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a <unk> look.
Karen <unk> We are a small brand.
<unk> to the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So doing things like that, you know, remind you to give people the reason that this interests us.
MS: What words would they use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
KF: That's a great question.
Volunteer: technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something new, cool.
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category at positive versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do you keep you better <unk> with better <unk> three times more cool.
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about <unk>
I need to talk to the man on the street, to people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like a good job.
Woman: Show the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what's the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of the dark colors, many gray colors and things like this.
They usually carry accessories like sunlight, or I like the <unk> and similar to me.
Volunteer: if Dan was a brand like a <unk> <unk> Mercedes <unk>
Man 2: the brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part of <unk> in part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pet guy.
They use toys in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is <unk> because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: Nation <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I am a <unk>
<unk> I am <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be made Tom, but I often went into the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way of being.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which we think about how people around you, your friends, the way you live your life, the work you live in.
All of those things come from, and they start in a place and start in a place and start in my family, and they start in my family, West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk?
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: how does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be me.
I like different things.
I like things weird -- I like things weird stuff.
A: Tell me about <unk> to what is that for you?
What is the <unk> What about <unk> you find you now?
Why is it important <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
<unk> little more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
I don't have to be afraid of what kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: thank you for your patience, <unk> Great <unk> A: Yes. Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
There was a lot of madness to all of this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> on your personality personality <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk>
They were very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only going to be <unk> in one of their strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to be -- and it's nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> to avoid fear, those items, and you actually give them to accommodate it, and you make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are like this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are playful marks and proteins, those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: A <unk> What is your <unk>
If someone asks you to get your brand your brand, your brand, what would that be?
Are you a <unk>
Or are you rather a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful as being playful as <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Or are you more of the attribute of <unk>
You're <unk> sophisticated as <unk>
You're <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You are <unk> stable, <unk> sure, sacred, <unk> or wise -- like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how now they use MRI to identify the centers of desire in the brain both for commercial marketing centers like for movies.
We went to St. Paulo where they have banned advertising to the open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are going on way in schools with money problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects in which I've had the greatest answer or the ones that I've had more successful are the ones that I've been doing with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went to the <unk> they took off their <unk> and they said maybe these agencies -- they don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to be thinking about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how did they gone? They had it success?
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we have had 900 billion of the media for this film.
This covers only a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's not online. It's not in <unk>
It hasn't even been presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has been started to win momentum.
And it's not bad for almost all the agencies that we talk to you about: their customers won't be part of it.
I've always believed that if you get to get risks if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunity.
I think when you get to the people of that is pushing to failure.
I think when you train your employees at loss aversion to risk aversion is preparing the whole company for the lack of rewards.
I feel that what it has to happen to us is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, we will go forward, I think we need to give it the fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear is <unk>
From a <unk> at once, we need to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to turn transparency.
More than never a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said that, with honesty and transparency, all my talk <unk> <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who was by <unk> the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> big data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So I <unk> on behalf of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check at the name of the 20th organization of TED, the <unk> Foundation -- a check for <unk> to be applied to my support for the next year.
The idea behind the worm <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their greatest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant <unk>
The gray boxes you see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software are a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put a Windows cash of Windows on a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray, <unk> then we're smart.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray, gray, damage the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we began to investigate <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> using multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed like to want to do something with these boxes, these control systems.
So that struck us attention, and we started an experiment in which we <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they spent very strange things.
<unk> <unk> like a laboratory rat who didn't like our <unk> <unk> but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And then after experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively searching in the gray box if it finds a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect is effectively working on that place.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because <unk> We don't know what the <unk> is.
It could be, let's say for example, a U.S. power plant or a chemical plant in Germany.
So better than we could have the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that I was <unk> in two <unk> bombs a little bit and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally <unk> by people that obviously had all the internal information.
<unk> all the points to attack.
You probably even know how much it was <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you heard that <unk> <unk> is complex, and high-tech and high technology, let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here's a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about about 15,000 lines of code.
It's pretty much like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find sense of this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning were calls in the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and we tried to deal with the real world, with the real world targets in the real world.
We need theories about how we could pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear energy plant plant and the <unk> plant <unk>
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and asked them in an effort by <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the small digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
So this is this cell phone inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly be <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in one obvious obvious attempt to get the blood engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and its structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't <unk>
I started to investigate scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And he got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the code of <unk>
An almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
And this gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in my hands.
So I didn't think it was like this.
The results have been taken after several weeks of hard work.
We had <unk> <unk> and we had to start again.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> would just look at one and the same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small little <unk> is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what's the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We shouldn't worry that other targets are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw, really <unk> me.
There's the gray, and the top box is the <unk>
What this thing does is intercept the input of input from the sensors for example, of the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and providing <unk> code -- which is still running during attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, this false input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not only <unk> the operators in the room of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not be able to act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the big steam turbine is going on speed, you have to open vacuum valves into a <unk>
Obviously, this can't do a human operator to do.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then they can go through bad things.
The plant can flow up.
And we don't have the <unk> or the security system <unk>
That scares it.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
There's nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a power plant, or a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> which disseminate this burden with a key <unk> like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional <unk> technology for <unk>
<unk> as much as possible.
And if you do that, with what <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large number of goals.
We need to deal with the implications, and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> OK, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My opinion is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the ultimate <unk>
Is there a alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because otherwise our problems would be even greater.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that you can take and give you a <unk> skills, or another thing that makes users of lawn chairs to raise and get back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
It's nothing different about something that gets in the morning, gives you a big force -- that you can also increase your speed, and help you for example, to drive the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect with the universe and with other things that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now in what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on his back a <unk> load of 45 pounds, and it's going to take you even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications -- lesions on the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage chronic damage.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can save 90 kilos for variables for many hours.
Their flexible design allows you to get into <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my <unk>
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back right now and look at the users of the wheelchair, on what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people roughly, in wheelchair around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, very young people with damage to the backbone of their life -- at 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and a wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that is going to be added quickly.
His only choice, many times -- by a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, since its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had an injury in the neocortical column and as a result couldn't go back to walk for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches who send signals to the board, here on the back.
There are also a batteries that give the motors to the <unk> and in the knees, and they make it move forward with this soft and very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, for a stranger jump in the air, skiing down it was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost every feeling and all of the motion of shattered down.
Little later, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> will never come back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole up to the last bit of hope of my self.
The technology of adapting since then, has enabled me to learn to <unk> it costs the bottom in <unk> <unk> and even riding <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit down and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations -- not only of soldiers, but to prepare and all of the users of chairs of the wheels, everybody.
AB: Thank you.
I've just come back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> they practice sex to say hi, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival. Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins.
This is the world of the <unk> <unk> of the Congo.
The bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, their living relatives live.
That means we all share a common ancestor, a evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done a lot of emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large, <unk> civil society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created a special thing, because this leads to a very tolerant society where violence has not been seen.
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of big <unk>
They live in the depths of the rainforests -- and it has been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> of a violent conflict that has doubled for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also puts in danger the survival.
The trade of hunting meat and deforestation makes you not <unk> or a stadium with the bonobos who have in the world -- and honestly, we are not safe from it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear laughter hidden by the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like the apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex, <unk> and <unk> to drive conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
By <unk> as humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
For us and the game is fundamental to establish bonds and foster <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors of connections.
And when you look at the surveillance game you see the roots that are going to look like the same laughter, the dance and the human <unk>
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple unique <unk> videos.
First, it's a game of <unk> <unk> and I don't talk about soccer.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just believe that in this case, he loves it, right?
Yeah.
So the sexual game is common in Bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing together unusual elements to play -- like <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> the <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with a <unk> water.
I think, like her, sometimes we play ourselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of understanding that the Bonobo gives us our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future where we need to adapt to a more difficult world with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we need to play.
But <unk> the most of our game capacity.
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
To bonobos and humans like life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems to be less appropriate to play, you can be the moments in which we are the most urgent thing.
So fellow primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and <unk> together as they <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for the development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires like a captain of captain in a <unk> body.
And in our city, where volunteers are terrified of a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the fire site very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going to go.
But there was still a race standing against the other volunteers to get the captain of the captain and figure out what our task was.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas and he was <unk> as his house was on fire.
The other volunteer who had just come out before I had me, <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> first to the captain and he asked him to go to the dog on the owner of the house.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people that I entered in a building in the building to save a live -- just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need one of the home.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and he brings this woman a couple of <unk>
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I was hoping but I was hoping but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the fire firefighters that at that height or less had finished off the fire and walked into the top room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back to the ladder where I met my <unk> and the precious dog in the front door.
<unk> out of the house, the <unk> for your own house where, as he was to expect, his trove of <unk> got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the house owner of the brave house to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at over the rest of the other was someone had ever reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as voluntary fireman I am witness to generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of grace and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or are for us to make remarkable levels of success -- I'd like to remind you to remind you to not wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give you a <unk> now.
<unk> food in a dining room, a <unk> park.
They are mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save the life of someone but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So I trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange -- but I'm a big fan of the block of concrete.
The first blocks of concrete was built in <unk> with a very simple idea of cement from a fixed measure that fit it together.
Very quickly, these became the most used building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than we, as buildings or bridges, a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> it came up with this.
He called it <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to all the home.
It's been estimated that they've made more than 400 billion or 75 blocks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, or <unk>
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new block of construction.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would lead us from a world of aesthetic bricks and piled on each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the block of concrete, the transistor allows you to create a much larger circuits and more complex circuits a brick at once.
But there's a <unk> difference, the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't personally know that the building blocks of our time are reserved to the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they connect through magnets.
So you can't place it in the wrong way.
<unk> have a light code.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color.
So you only have to assemble a blue blue with one green and very quickly, you can start to make bigger circuits.
One blue blue with one green produce light.
Can we put a button in the middle and we have a <unk>
If we change the button through a pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
So let's get this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to <unk> connect and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make it faster or slower or slower -- just a button that makes your pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a wider collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> sound, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We have <unk> children to see them play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics of every day you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a night of night, or why the door of a elevator is kept open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers with no experience in electronics begin to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>  A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the designers at the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island, who don't have experienced experience in cardboard, and we said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> cannon <unk>
But hang on, here comes my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is a fear of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be at the reach of all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interactive world is ours.
So ahead and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking for engaging with the environment focusing on the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> can we continue to get the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I'm already going to be a term time.
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that we were supposed to work on in the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and they would be like <unk> Peace <unk>
We had a few members every year and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to Third World, we send them to the wild world.
They made great <unk> they worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> in Boston.
Here it appears as if you find a quote, but what really looks for is that someone else is going to clean out the snow because he knows it's not very good when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it get to help <unk> this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment we were doing a lot of last year.
They realized that the city was never wiped out of these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else that citizens would have <unk> sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice app where you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case he got <unk>
If you don't, someone can be <unk>
I mean, it has a players' component here.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the U.S. government.
And it spreads in viral form.
One responsible for <unk> city <unk> when you see this application realized that I could use it -- not for snow, but for citizens to make <unk>
It's very important to work on these <unk> of tsunami, but people would take the batteries.
So he asks the citizens that <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago is just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they were born.
So now we know about nine cities that are going to use using it.
And this has been spreading out of <unk> in a natural way.
If you know a bit of government technology, you will know that this doesn't happen normally matter.
The acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to be able to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that they had done by the normal channels would have taken at least two years and side about two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there is a project in the court of California that until the moment has two million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that shows in a couple of days, and it spreads in viral form, is a kind of warning shot in the U.S. government.
It suggests the better ways of working, not as in private companies, as many people think it should be.
Neither as a technological company, but more like the Internet itself.
I mean, without constraints, just open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way of addressing the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of a <unk> institution, but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there's a very big community of people who are building the tools so that they are building together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to apps -- every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given to the government.
Do you feel a great frustration before that -- but they wouldn't be <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from view.
And that is that if we left the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that make us <unk> the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they alone doesn't <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The policy is not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government has ultimately spread from -- remember that from <unk> <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people who are <unk> <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially a matter of <unk>
This is the service center of service and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you mark <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
<unk> <unk> at the official knowledge.
I didn't find anything. He started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put it very strong and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a telephone center.
It has a phone and mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
They don't have that application.
It was the work of very clever people from the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this really came up with this <unk> <unk> in my garbage cube I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do it for <unk>
<unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was talking to person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went to the place, found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good Panama <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical.
And it's also a great example of government income to <unk> voluntary collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of <unk>
I'm talking about a platform for people to become <unk> and help others.
So, a citizen helped another one, but the government had a key role.
We connected two people.
And it could be connected to government services to be necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than government services.
When one neighbor helps other people, they <unk> the communities.
If we call the control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but think that one is the input of the other.
That our entry to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen to a <unk> leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government is going to take our values and make our needs but then we don't see changes.
That is because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface layer of 15.
And underneath it is what we call <unk>
And we say that word <unk>
But it's that <unk> that keeps us that that we financed as something that we financed as something that operates in our without the other thing, and in consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is <unk>
If we want this institution to work we will have to make the bureaucracy is <unk>
Because it's where the real work of government.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They have <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed <unk> report in response to the order of <unk> <unk> <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not a political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And so for those of us that have been given to the government, it's time for us to ask what world we want to leave to our children.
You have to look at the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we're going to get to where we need to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of everybody who can act in the name of all?
We cannot ignore government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function in the way that it can expand to the civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and it knows it's not that hard to act <unk> we just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I am, <unk> I'm a bigger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up with the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to speak about who are going to talk about.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and do it.
So when they face the government problem, you don't really care about to hear their voices.
They're using their hands.
They put hands to the work to program applications that do better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be washing a fire fire -- you know, dumping it a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were always able to have <unk> those fire hydrants and a lot of people doing it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't <unk> the <unk>
So I want to ask everyone here, when it's about the important things that we need to do together, all of us are going to be a crowd of voices, or we'll be going to be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these stimulus has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are saying here have impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here's what we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I actually didn't learn this in the practice of the law, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a African-American family dominated by a <unk> who was my grandmother.
It was hard was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in all discussions in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was a hard but she was also <unk>
When I was small and I looked at her, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
I felt so strong I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I would go back to <unk> and he said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I told him no, I would get back and if I told him I know, I left peace.
He had this human quality that I would always want to want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the least of 10.
On times, when I was going to spend a time with her, it was not easy to capture their time and his attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight, nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me.
I thought it was a game.
So I looked at the looked at her and smile, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up, went through the room, I took my hand and said, "Come on, "Come <unk> We are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I didn't know it, I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and he looked at me and said, "I want you to know I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> who are <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "I don't want me to give me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do is you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
Like I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> I'm going to do."
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to talk about is that you will always do the right thing even though the right thing to be <unk>
I thought of it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I do."
Then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to talk about is that I never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> I'm going to do."
I grew up in the field in South rural and I have a brother older and one sister a younger year.
When I was 14  15, a day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> grabbed us to my sister and me and went to the forest.
We just get all of the <unk> all the time.
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> and you always do the same thing as we are.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No, I wouldn't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me."
And he said, "What happens? Take a <unk>
And I turned out to look at the <unk> and <unk> "Oh, I'm not going to be thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is being <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this thinking it's a <unk> I say it by the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that actually don't make sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all their grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of diseases related to alcohol.
And these were the things that it was, according to her, we had to <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different today than a 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people on parole.
And this mass <unk> in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black, you find so much <unk> so much despair, determined by these facts.
One of every three black men between the 18 and 30 years is in prison or parole.
In the urban <unk> of all over the country, Los Angeles, Baltimore Baltimore, Washington, 50 to 60 percent of all the young people in jail are in jail or <unk>
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that is a lot better if you're rich and guilty, that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth will affect the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not our problems.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work with some of a very curious developments in work.
In my state, in Alabama, as in other states, you don't care about rights for always if you have criminal property.
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of black male population has lost the right to the vote.
And if we projected it to the next 10 years a loss of rights to be as elevated as it was before it was <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where the children were <unk> to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for children, no chance of coming out.
Now we're in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in death row people.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, they have asked us to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by crimes of <unk> but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by mistake.
In every nine people who have been identified with one that is innocent that it's <unk> and liberated from death row of death.
A <unk> error, <unk> an innocent in every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would not be able to be able to run airplanes if every nine to <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we care about the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classroom with students on history -- I talk about slavery, I talk about slavery to them.
I'm talking about terror, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction and that lasted to the Second World War.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a time defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined his lives.
Now there are older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teach talks, you do <unk> to the people who stop saying that in our history deal with the first time with terror, after <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of <unk> and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All the time we had to do with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about "I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that you couldn't overcome <unk> without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said, "You know it's very disturbing to listen to what you would do.
<unk> We don't have a death penalty in Germany.
You can never be able to take it up here."
The room was silent and a lady said, "There's no way with our story, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational to us, <unk> and <unk> us to put the people."
<unk> about this.
How would we be involved in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their own <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these issues, the positive things and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology -- <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, <unk> <unk>
In my view, we need to integrate two things.
Now, lately we talk about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more engagement with the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, <unk> them that will never come to TED.
If you think about them is, in a way, something that is within our self.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to the intellectual thing.
So with innovation, development is not only about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas on the heart of the heart.
This connection of the mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the brilliant and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard thing.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED must be <unk>
There's no kind of <unk> disconnect with technology and design that allows us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty to <unk> to inequality, for injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege being a very young lawyer of meeting Rosa <unk>
These women were gathering just to talk about.
Occasionally, I was called <unk> to say, <unk> comes <unk>
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "Be lady. I know <unk>
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And at one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. <unk> went to me and said, "Now, <unk> <unk> me who is that idea of <unk> justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help which have been doomed <unk>
We tried to confront prejudice and discrimination in the criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom hello for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We're trying to end up with the <unk> <unk>
And I gave all my best speech and he looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that moment, Mrs. <unk> got my finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be too <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way of dealing with those challenges, those issues, that suffering.
Because ultimately humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher than we have <unk>
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't survive, it's not a <unk>
Even, if someone kills another, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> -- and we don't judge us to judge our technology, for our designs, not for our intellectual and rational.
At the end, the character of a society, not because of the way they treat the rich, powerful and <unk> but in the way they treat the poor, the <unk> prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand really deep themes about what we are.
Sometimes I'm going to end up with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, <unk>
Sometimes those ideas are going beyond my ideas in an important way.
I've been representing these kids who have been a lot of <unk>
I'm going to prison, and I see my customers from 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so they were <unk> as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to someone who isn't it?
Justice <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
One night later, I was very late -- my God, if the judge can become something that you don't are, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was too late, I couldn't think of it right, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a <unk> customer -- a little <unk> black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> saying, <unk> for my 14-year-old <unk> it's treated like a <unk> <unk> <unk> executive from a <unk>
In the <unk> I put there there had been <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had it <unk> it was sent to court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And I finally got my God, God, I have to go to the court for this case, stupid.
I got to the car and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I was in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally dropped out of the car, <unk> the court.
I was going up the stairs when I met with a black man -- he was the <unk> of the court.
When he looked at me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's <unk> I said yes.
And so I approached it, and I <unk>
And I stayed at the ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That's deeply connected to me, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When I arrived, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this <unk> <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> and we began to go.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the guy who had written those <unk>
They got the policemen the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people. And all of us were talking about race, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I went to see the <unk> that was going and <unk>
I would look at the window, and you would try and hear all of that <unk>
I was walking around here and there.
Finally, this old black -- with the face of worry, I walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, Justice <unk> <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> he showed himself because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant was <unk> on the old black black.
And he said, "Well, what do you do?"
And the old black boy stood up, I looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> this young room to tell this young man who would keep his view in the target with <unk>
I've come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds towards justice.
We can't really be <unk> if we don't care about human rights and <unk>
That our survival is attached to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of you here who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> from hearing and see an icon of the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
Something that isn't a <unk> What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities close to it.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which an effort is going to be a <unk> effort that you spend today on policy policies.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row, in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases are not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> of rapes don't get there.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are <unk> these funds to make the law, for security.
I think there is a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in crime in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, you say it has to do with the largest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who believe it is?
<unk> actually, the crime rate with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in massive <unk> in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's about the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince you about the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into chain to <unk> to steal a bicycle, by small crimes against property, instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does not do anything for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> Have you excited about us today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months -- they might be over the last six days, or the last six years.
The idea is that media means <unk> negative news -- because our minds are paying attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second one day our senses are receiving a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters more than survive, the first stop of all of those data is an old fragment of the temporal lobe called the <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector that is in danger.
<unk> and records all the information for something in the environment that could make harm.
So from a <unk> of stories, we would look at the negative.
That old saying of <unk> "If there's blood, <unk> is very true.
And since all digital devices provide us negative news, seven days of a week, 24 hours a day, no wonder that we're <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong with worse.
But maybe it's not like this.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we got <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our problems, the climate change, the <unk> of species, water and <unk> and <unk> no doubt we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and the long run, we just had them.
Let's take the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average income per capita run by inflation has been <unk> across the world.
Child mortality has been reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, the transportation of transportation and communications has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pinker showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the world's literacy happened from 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget it.
And we continue to get more and higher at <unk>
In fact, we redefined the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, large part of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, toilets, toilets, television, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
And so much of this is a lot of this technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the performance of the price for about 12 to 24 months.
That's why the mobile phone is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First, the soft thing -- in good and bad time, in the war and peace, in recession in <unk> and <unk>
It's the rush of computers used to build <unk> computers.
It stops before none of the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> on a law on the left, it curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is actually getting faster.
And in this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends in <unk> call computing and sensors, and networks, and the 3D printing and their ability to democratize and distribute personalized production throughout the planet, synthetic biology, the fuel and food, the <unk> and the food, the <unk> and the food, the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory of Watson, of Watson, of <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at the newspapers the best headline I had.
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not a easy game.
<unk> with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all of the mobile phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the big challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or a service that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, I would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating plenty, doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each of the planet, it is about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that that is <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
This is a story of Napoleon <unk> in the Philadelphia.
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon ate with <unk> of silver, and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of the <unk> to Washington is aluminum <unk>
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth -- it doesn't come like pure <unk>
It's bound by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made the aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
And we had this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet that is about 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated of <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, the MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about the wars in the water.
You remember when Carl Sagan pointed out the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after I spent <unk>
<unk> a famous picture, how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater, two percent of the ice is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there's a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> the <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator of a child.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of water to the day of any single source -- saltwater, water water -- a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola has just realized that I'm going to do a major test for hundreds of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence in that way, Coca-Cola is going to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation by this technology that is today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to the 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the developing world.
That mighty warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya who President President years ago.
And to have a smart phone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid for and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video <unk> images, libraries of books, and music, <unk> technology -- now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best happens to get the applications in health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation -- something called the X Prize <unk> <unk> of 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the teams of the world to bring these technologies into a mobile device with the ones that talk, and because it has <unk> can be extracted blood from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent of the health care workers.
When this device would take a tube of RNA or DNA that we don't want to call the health care and first of all, avoid the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the billion increasing.
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through a brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against the demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, spending two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds never before <unk> to the global conversation.
What would you want these people?
What <unk> What desires are we <unk>
And instead of economic collapse, we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and due to the use of impressions in 3D and the computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us three billion more of our healthy humanity, healthy and <unk>
How about voices never before <unk>
What if we give them <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be heard and power to act for the first time?
What about these 3,000 dollars?
And if they are contributions we can't afford it.
Something that I learned with the X X is that small teams guided by their passion with a clear goal -- can do things that are going to be able to do things that are going to do things that were going to do the great corporations and the governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really bothers me.
There is a program that maybe some of them.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
<unk> shapes the structure and the <unk>
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this college professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started <unk>
And it has shown today the machinery of human patterns is better <unk> proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me an enormous confidence in the future is that we have more power to take people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion for <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are <unk> to work in the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have some extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I'll give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like this.
They actually <unk> fish.
And it described to one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk> <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about Galapagos and other places, so that's nothing special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept: of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a world in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun, and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The world was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, of about mangroves.
There was a <unk> of about 20 centimeters, the black steps.
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so I was made more than the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later the number of fish had dropped to half.
They went to the five inches.
<unk> a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing has changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was supposed to impose the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the Industrial license.
And this boat, pretty <unk> was called <unk> four.
And I went out to fish in it, and we had studies in the southern Sea Sea, and above all, in the Beaufort Sea.
What we captured there was something <unk>
<unk> I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are at the bottom.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny ones about <unk> remains that are fish reef fish.
In short, the sea floor came to cover and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then you start the commercial fishing up.
The bottom is going to be a solid background of soft coral in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
They didn't <unk> them, because they were dead.
Once we captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
And then they wanted to be <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen collect every time you go to an area where they've never fish.
But there is no <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember it.
So let's get the beginning of starting to the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, number of killer whales, the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. Changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation using the images I received to the beginning of their conscious life as the normal and I'll extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss of loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the notion of changes.
And at the end of it to keep some <unk> remains.
And that, in a big measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when ethnic societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because obviously, an animal is very plentiful, before it's <unk> it's <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose <unk> animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a lot of loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea synonymous with big fish.
They become unusual because the <unk>
Over time, there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they'll do it because the evidence presented in a previous way is not the way they would expect to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of you have presented as a captain such as a captain of a lot of fish in this area cannot be used -- or usually they don't use them <unk> because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
So the enormous role that can make a protected marine area.
Because with the marine areas, we actually recreating the past.
We were going to see the past that people can't conceive of, because the starting point has been run and it's very low.
That's for the people who can see a protected protected area and they can benefit from the vision that <unk> which allows them to erase their point of <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the <unk> for example?
I think there are arts and cinema -- maybe they can fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay of <unk>
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the Bay Area 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were <unk> with the movie <unk> why <unk> with the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is <unk> <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and I look at YouTube YouTube videos.
It's true.
So today we will see why the videos are <unk> and how important it has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, and when I was younger, that seemed a very, very difficult thing.
But today your web makes any of us, or our actions, copper in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be done famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They climb over 48 hours of video YouTube per minute.
And, of those, only a small percentage is viral gets lots of visits to and wins cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things -- creators of trends, and participation and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh, my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this <unk> video outside his house in Yellowstone National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the views on the rise of popularity last summer.
<unk> I wasn't saying to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a rainbow as long.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were already published many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> came up with the <unk> to <unk>
The creators as Jimmy <unk> are presented with new things and interesting to them to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  That's Friday, Friday. You have to start on a Friday.   Everyone wants to get a weekend, the weekend <unk>   <unk> Friday. So you would not think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> of RS: Black is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have emerged from nothing.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday, <unk>
Well, he took them <unk> and many blogs started to write about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science Science was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or a group of creators embrace a point of view and share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who shares this big internal joke and then start talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Only in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other day.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this community engagement is our way of being part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a repetitive animation.
That's what it is.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know there's a version of three hours that has seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats see the video.
But what's important here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made an old version of the old one.
And then it became international it.
Suddenly, it came up with a whole community of remixes that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all be able to be there.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who might have predicted <unk> or <unk> or Rebecca or <unk> <unk>
What script could we have had been written by this situation?
In a world where you go up two days of video just for a minute, just that truly unexpected and unexpected can be <unk> the way these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this big video of a kind that protest against <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit I wasn't interested in it too much.
Casey <unk> I would be <unk> because of the <unk> but often there are obstacles that get rid of it properly by the <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise and his humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth all the new thing we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads us to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> creative communities of participation, the fully unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of media, and that we all have access and is the audience that defines <unk>
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
They don't have permission to express their ideas.
Now we are all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the media, are just the media characteristics -- but they are <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a man whose entire life had been supported by the only unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so friends, now <unk>
They were <unk> in silence.
He died in the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to be treated but I was doing it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat to the dawn <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> had just 18 years when her father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
In order to her, life had been destined to have the escape from her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her who couldn't do it.
And then from a four years that challenges the fiction, a boat would get in the sea of the <unk>
Every adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear were the funding, the rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> with poison.
If we get rid of it, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the motor, the <unk> diving into each <unk> and the vast and empty horizon and gap.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men in our boat, or dying and not being able to <unk> for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, to finish the journey was too much for it; and the first apple I did, given for the men of the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women along three generations and shape a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> suburb whose population is comprised of immigration.
Unlike the suburbs of middle-class class, which I <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were from the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English snippets were <unk> between the people who had one thing in common.
My mother worked in farms, then on a assembly line, working six days ago.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a degree in IT <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, wouldn't mind what it was supposed to be, which was usually <unk> <unk> was always <unk>
Two pairs of <unk> for school, one to hide holes in the other.
A school uniform until the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there was <unk> and <unk> about <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> go back home."
At home, where?
Something in me was <unk>
He was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were focused on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at the house.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be awake until their nightmares started to be able to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women were coming with their stories about men who couldn't do the transition and angry and <unk> boys and <unk> trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, I was the classic <unk> student with what I was talking about myself.
On the other hand, I was <unk> in life in <unk> <unk> <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many of them received help over the years.
And because of that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer -- the young Australian young <unk>
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges of the <unk>
As <unk> resident <unk> was now so <unk> refugee and social activist.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the loved life of life in a <unk> suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters finishing the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had the same age that she had when she got to the ship.
He hadn't been a choice.
<unk> told me, "What do you not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> to <unk> and <unk>
And the more frankly I talked about, the more I was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the paths of life, so many of them doing what they were doing -- living on the border of possible.
And although I ended up my day I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk> career.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be an unknown thing, a newly new side on the scene -- and not only it's good, but it's something that being grateful, perhaps a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
And I gave enough steps outside of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
They didn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, a silent optimism -- a weird mix of humility and <unk>
So I followed my intuition.
They went to a small group of people who who said, "You can't <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant soup that all <unk>
<unk> to well at night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some bright and we opened up.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
After one journey.
My <unk>
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before finally, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had no changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of her husband, caused an <unk> to the <unk> and take the cause to her, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't have proved it to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room in <unk> when she died, <unk> <unk> in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw her standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called a minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell the stories and make sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came up and told us he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"Don't have <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since those of us who were and how life we set up now we can now see that the men who had come to our lives would have <unk>
<unk> would have <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could do that for you?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy, right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave at each other, the <unk> rate of the motor, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see safe, you would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of so is here today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were a conversation about how nothing has changed from the old American <unk> "The <unk>
In those days, when Indians wanted to travel to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
So at that time when I was <unk> the great prince warrior Indian, I had <unk> it took a bow and a <unk> to the ground, he got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we launched was that the machinery were replaced with the magic.
And that was a great deal.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I got this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
I looked like the technology had to allow the magic to do not kill her.
As a girl my grandfather gave me her <unk> <unk>
And this piece of <unk> of 50 years was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world filled with images, of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
And I had the feeling that the mobile phone, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them out there.
We <unk> our inspiration.
So I <unk> I came up to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of kill her.
I had books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad saw a narrative device able to connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we took the book.
Where we are.
They collect the text with the image, the picture, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes more and more <unk>
But what does that do us?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so --  He says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In several moments I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- which comes to me.
My inner girl gets excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, which is those ideas that we use of children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned out to me.
So, over here, we need to break the iPad to release fireflies.
And actually, they light up your way on what the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world turns into a <unk> that I drag to this magic device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In the whole book of a fantasy book there has always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that goes back, <unk> and guide you through the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book, they also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another tremendously important aspect to me is to create Indian content, and the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people out of India know their counterparts were <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in <unk> cameras for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
That's why we're bringing them back into a <unk> child history.
In a story that is about current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not left to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can bring our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure that you need to go out in the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a girl, I had a lot of <unk> of <unk> stones, stones, and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to regain this childhood ritual we have to go out and on a chapter, and we had a photo to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So this way it creates a digital collection of photos that then can be put on the Web.
A picture of London puts a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the other variants of connection between magic, Earth and technology is a lot of possibilities.
In the next book we could have an interaction in which one comes out with the iPad and the video turns out and actually augmented it sees a bunch of cartoons that appear on the inner plants of the house.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves there.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature will be associated with technology and the magic and technology comes to one another.
We use the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves the natural world and that magic and joy and love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and asked patients, family and <unk> What <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for all of us, or perhaps not all, but most of the projects of <unk> fail, because we stopped listening.
This is my Wi-Fi <unk> It's a very simple thing.
It has a <unk> and <unk>
Every morning I was surprised.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 percent.
But it is so simple, that every time I <unk> it sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my problem of weight, not at the same time when it needs to be <unk> or some urgency of that style -- but see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have over 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my <unk> Wi-Fi and before my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light.
That's the best that it can happen, because it's pressure pressure used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also so that patients quit smoking.
On the other hand, can be <unk> to move people from their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From next week, it's available to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people were going to stay from their homes, taking their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back to recover control and to be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care about health care, because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the health care and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like these, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share it with you with you.
We all have a navigation controls in the <unk>
Maybe we even have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where the ATM ATM in <unk>
So where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find mobile food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we did <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public public, you see a <unk> by favor of <unk> <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes you open up in <unk> <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an application for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> can use your iPhone, and the next weeks to use their cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we would want to go down to the world.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find and work and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> all over the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us validate these <unk>
They could be <unk> or <unk> <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> show is still in their place.
Please do it in this and not only improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, it's photographs that can't take their cameras.
My interest in photography woke up with my first <unk> digital camera.
I mixed with my previous passion before, but it was a little bit different because when I use the camera the process was on the planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when you press the <unk>
To me photography had more to be in the right place, at the right time.
I thought anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to press the <unk>
<unk> like this one: a <unk> road <unk>
But it has a unexpected.
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful at once but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say <unk> I mean <unk>
Because of course, it's not something I can do, but I always want it to seem to be captured in some way as a photograph.
<unk> where you're going to have to think a moment to discover the trick.
It's more about capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem real real.
Are you the details or the <unk>
You have the light?
What does the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But in the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive in a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we took different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way you can create something that still seems <unk> as if there was there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's look at the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really going to combine different <unk>
And the things that make a picture look like seem realistic -- I think they're those where they don't even match the things around us in our daily lives.
But when you combine photographs of it very important -- because otherwise something is wrong.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic outcomes.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures <unk> must have the same kind of light.
And these two images do with these <unk> they were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make us impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect place.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is totally composed of photographs of different places.
And in the staff, I think it's easier to create a place that would find it because you don't need to put the ideas in the head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew I had several months for <unk> to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone.
And yes, I even did red the house on the top of the island to make it more <unk>
So in order to get a realistic result I think it takes planning.
You always start with a sketch, a idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful and a very realistic time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a slide on technology, very boring.
Please, if you can <unk>
This is a diagram that I took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not very interested in showing you the details but the general aspect of it.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
What is interesting about this is that this one, as many other things we tend to see, it's a straight kind of line on a <unk>
In other words, every step here represents a order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
So talk about technology with <unk> curves -- is something new.
So here's something weird.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn the lights up.
<unk> more intensity because I write about paper.
Why do we <unk> <unk> <unk>
The answer is that if you draw them on a normal curve in which, say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to show you the diagram would see something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if you will, for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb -- we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of transportation is as fast as we could have a <unk> tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There's no unprecedented in the history of technological growth, that every few years advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- look at these <unk> curves that are not going to be forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
You get one of two things.
Or it will be a typical curve. I know like this until it comes up with something totally different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what it used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask me, is, what is that new way that you adopt the world?
How new is the world?
The transition seems very, very <unk> if we are engaged in it.
I remember a kid in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, along my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
It happens a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition that <unk>
But to do that I'll have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The scale of time I would like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every one billion years.
So we go back a couple of two million years when the Earth was a big <unk> rock with many chemicals that would be <unk> around them.
If you look at the way that these chemicals were organized with us a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and that is that, at that time, it had floating about oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those drops of oil held a particular combination of chemicals that made them to incorporate materials from the outside and so drops grew up grew up grew up grew up in the outside of the outside and the drops grew together.
And they started <unk>
And in a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms, those oil <unk>
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time you <unk> <unk> a chemical distribution of the chemicals that <unk>
So every drop was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow they become better at the time to incorporate chemical chemicals -- they grew more chemicals and <unk> more chemicals and <unk> more.
Most of the time, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, life -- very simple, but things are interesting to us when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way that we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, we will be able to do in this <unk> evolution, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two million years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, you have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things that I did just by <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of dust out of dust that I'm trying to hide into the safety of security
But <unk> took this <unk> the code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants to want 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and is here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy another billion years.
But then it came up with another big step in which things were very different, and it was that these cells started to be able to exchange and communicate information to form that communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some of the bacteria found the way we avoid penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are many resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and a <unk>
And so <unk> or <unk> together, or it is that if a community was very successful all of the individuals in that community are <unk> and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities were approached so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe out of the community board into a DNA chain.
The next stage is interesting for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities that are <unk> communities from many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell is not without the heart of the heart, or your muscles or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels that cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that didn't make information in the community.
It's the neural structures.
These neurons are the devices that process the information that those communities <unk>
In fact, they started <unk> inside the community being the very responsible structures of <unk> understanding and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the time period of evolutionary time.
So, an organism can, for example, learn not to eat some fruit because he knew bad and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen in the life of an organism because since they had built these information structures that evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit together.
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in time for learning to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, and I have a <unk> idea.
I'm sitting here emitting a few <unk> and hopefully building a very similar idea, vague and <unk> in their heads that saved some analogy with mine.
But we took something very complicated to turn it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started doing abstractions.
We now spend through periods of similar periods of organisms that are <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
<unk> computer <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster, and able to evolve more than we were doing before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
You saw the evolutionary <unk> evolutionary <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program to our eyes.
And now we've accelerated time scales again.
The first stages of the story that I told you took a billion years each.
The next few of you can see the nervous system and the brain, it took a few hundred million years.
So the next thing, the language and so on, they took less than a million years.
And the next thing, like electronics, seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess it's the right word to name something that accelerates your own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent computer advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to <unk>
I don't know that every transistor on that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we thought a level of abstraction, we put it in the machine and the machine with that makes something that you couldn't possibly do, it gets much further and faster than never before.
In fact, sometimes they use methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please be able to run a hundred million points of <unk>
You could run these kinds of instructions at chance, run all of those programs, and take the ones that are <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are more close to <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely to be a random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that you better did <unk>
We would get those and <unk> to the rest.
And now I think they better ordered the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, that <unk> <unk> and that the children would have the properties of both of them.
So we got a new generation of programs that was a product of the combinations of programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please, repeat <unk>
<unk> again.
They were able to put some mutations together.
And it tries to do it with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or a few minutes or complicated, in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that were going to be <unk> <unk>
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell how they work.
I've tried to study them to see how they work.
These are dark programs, strangers.
But do the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security that they get to the goal because they come from a bloodline of hundreds of thousands of programs that were doing it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on this.
One time I went in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulls up a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to offer a <unk> flight, don't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to rely on computers to make a very different design processes of design.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the options that are there.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so they could run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the ultimate product of evolution.
And I think we all are part of the creation of what it is to come.
But now comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent time enough to let me give up a part of my fake <unk> on that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end of the end, the <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's about getting <unk> the <unk> talks about statistics and use them to form a great baseball.
I'm going to focus on one of them and hope that many of you know.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we talked about 300, a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means that the bat <unk> three 10 times.
That means to launch the ball into the game without being <unk> and that anyone who is trying to get it to the first base, don't come to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three thousand 10.
You know what they call a <unk> <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, really, maybe the team of stars.
You know what they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's somebody that 10 <unk> I hit me.
<unk> like the fabled Ted Williams, the last player in the Women's League of <unk> in running more <unk> <unk>
Now I think about this to my world of medicine where I feel much more <unk> or perhaps less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they are <unk> to a surgeon who has a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place and a dear self has two arteries <unk> <unk> and their family doctor is derived from a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is 200 <unk>
But you know what?
She's getting very much better.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you to ask them.
What do you believe that you must be the average of hits from a heart surgeon, or a <unk> or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the matter is that nobody in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, however, is <unk> the world, and I included, with the <unk> <unk>
I never, ever make a mistake and try and figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a graduate student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman studying until a blood test.
Just like that.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> residence in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and <unk> <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the diagnostic diagnosis -- frequent <unk>
And I even knew the differential diagnosis about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And while they get more and more knowledge.
And I was going very well; I graduated with <unk>
And you know about the school school with the impression that if you were able to figure it out, then you would know everything, or as possible, close to everything, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met <unk>
I was a resident at a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought to the lunch lady in the emergency room where I worked.
At the time I was assigned to <unk> service.
And when emergency room requested a cardiologist I was going to attend to that patient at the time.
It will inform the head of residents.
When I saw <unk> lady was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which was a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and, instead of <unk> blood forward, blood goes to our lungs, these are <unk> and so there's a difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work in the treatment that I read about.
We gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in his heart.
We gave him <unk> pills for water, so I could eliminate liquid.
And at one hour or two, she began to feel better.
And I felt very well.
And there was when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two mistakes in it.
He sent her home without talking to the head of residents.
I didn't get the phone and I did what I should have done, that I was to call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss had seen it, I would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to get a constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be as successful and able to take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send it to her home, I didn't even pay attention to a voice in my inner saying, <unk> it's not a good idea.
In fact, I was so insecure that until I asked the nurse that I was <unk> <unk> <unk> who is okay if you're going to their <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said, "Yes, I think it's right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he was singing and the ambulance together with the ambulance men took them home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in your stomach.
But I went through my job.
At the end of the day, I was able to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking lot where my car was my car to go home. At that moment I did something that I don't do normally, I don't usually do it.
It went through the emergency emergency room at home.
And then another nurse, I don't know that I was talking about the lunch lady before, but another one.
Other specialists fear fear of them, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and it's that we see the patients.
The three words are <unk> Do you remember you?
"It remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
After an hour I had come to his house, after I was him, he suffered and her family called the <unk> the ambulance who brought them to emergency room with a <unk> blood pressure <unk> which means a shock of severe.
I was just breathing and was blue.
The emergency staff will bring all their resources.
They gave her medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk> <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mix of feelings because after <unk> was in intensive therapy and expected every hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days of course it was clear that they never <unk>
He had a permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, they were <unk> to what was happening.
And to the ninth day, he stopped to go. The lady <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
So the weeks later, I was scared by that and experienced for the first time <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt himself, you have <unk> <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't relate to your colleagues.
You make peace and it never makes that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is that makes us feel very bad at it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we are bad.
And that felt about.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was <unk>
I spoke to the family and I'm sure I would take things out and made sure that I didn't get it away.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he send her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why did I made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
Little <unk> that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And in one day he opened the sky and finally came out of the sun, and I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if you <unk> the efforts to be perfect to make no more mistakes, I would leave those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, I was an assistant at the emergency department in a community department in northern Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked at her because he was a little bit <unk>
He sent him penicillin and sent him home.
But while he went to the door, he kept pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my parents' change, my head asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I had the three words: Do you remember you?
Remember the patient who saw a pain in <unk>
And he came back and he had no <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially mortal condition. called <unk>
You can put it into Google. It's an infection, not because of the throat, but it's the top, and it can cause the close of those tracks.
He said, fortunately, I don't know.
They were <unk> antibiotics by <unk> and recovered in the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back and went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were used to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation that I had to do.
It turns out an X-ray of kidneys, but it turned out a <unk> -- a colleague who was checking the patient to a certain sensitivity on the bottom right-hand corner and called the surgeon <unk>
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read a liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague to do it.
I checked out and seeing some sensitivity on the lower right-hand corner, called the surgeon <unk>
Both of them were operated operated and recovered well.
But every single case I became <unk>
But I'd like to tell you I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say, is a <unk>
The most significant have been over the last five years.
<unk> welcome and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't tell you and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this to make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard of somebody talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course in a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- believe it would have a hard time to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of errors.
It's the system where there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and whatever, which they can't sleep and the ones that I know -- those who have <unk> results and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, as antibodies that start attacking that person.
We have the idea that if you think about medicine to the people who make mistakes, we will have safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I have done a personal <unk> <unk> and mistakes of doctors to learn as possible, from the first article that I wrote for the Toronto, "Star <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> white, art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where the mistakes happen every day, where one of every 10 drugs are going on in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> in a system in which <unk> infections are getting more and more <unk> and <unk> and death.
In this country, they die, they were dying by 24,000 medical errors.
The U.S. medicine Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so they're things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is going to be added every two or three years, and we don't care about it.
<unk> sleep is <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain -- he comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and I breath to alcohol and, all of a sudden my story was <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't have their symptoms always in the same way.
For all this, the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we would get rid of all the professionals prone to mistake, well, you won't get anybody.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> <unk> art -- it's a custom and say, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from the ambulance and the head of surgery -- "This is my worst <unk> blah blah -- "What are your <unk> And <unk> the microphone into them.
And their students are <unk> to go down the head and <unk> saliva and start counting their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> doctor is human, you know human -- they accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but it's trying to learn from what happened to teach others.
They had their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
They gave the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and support for everybody to <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes of time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human, <unk> mistakes.
And I feel a lot, but I have effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take one day.
Do you know how much we choose a week?
I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to choose an average American American.
Not a lot, in a research followed by a week to a group of members of business.
The researchers reported the different tasks that were inspired by these executives and the time that they were doing in making decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> a week.
Naturally, every work included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of your time.
Now think of your elections.
Do you know how many belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How do we fix the way that we deal with these decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing to the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
While I'm talking about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I do a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this supermarket at a very, very <unk> level at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were about 250 different kinds of mustard mustard and <unk> over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of water -- and this was when we were taking water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I was asked to ask myself, why never I buy nothing?
This is the oil shelf <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> box that came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and asked him, <unk> this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed up with the buses full of tourists that came up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had a different classes.
I would take a post to <unk> right to the store.
We put it out of six <unk> or 24 flavors of different flavors -- and we looked at two things: First, in which case people were willing to stop the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a <unk> that when there were only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
When there was 24, only three percent of them stopped buying <unk>
What stood in when there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we make the calculations, people were six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six, that if they found 24, they found 24.
Well, decide that we don't buy <unk> probably <unk> <unk> less is good to keep <unk> but it turns out that the problem of <unk> choices affect us rather <unk> decisions.
We decided to not decide, even when this is not <unk>
Now the day, the financial savings issue.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we look at the decisions about savings for about a million Americans, from a million U.S. plans in this country.
And we were interested in seeing if the number of public funds available to family plans for retirement, the program <unk> <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of funds were <unk> there were less participation.
So if you look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that offer two funding, the rate of participation was 70 percent or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offer about 60 funds, the rate of participation came to the '60s.
It turns out even if you decide to participate, when you have more choice, even in that case, there is negative consequences.
So for the ones that they decided to participate, the bigger it was the number of choice, more people <unk> to avoid actions or hedge funds.
As much more options, they were more willing to invest in financial financial account.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are going to do to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three major negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we make the decision that <unk> even when this is going against self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things out of <unk> even though objectively even though it will be better.
The main reason is that we were looking at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations to <unk> and choose that awesome <unk>
Today I want to tell you about four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so you can test in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've been hearing before, but it has never been more true than today, that less is more.
People always care about when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're looking at more and more is that if you decide to cut, get rid of strange <unk> options, there will be an increase in sales, <unk> the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation <unk> <unk> eliminated the products to deal with cats that fewer <unk> became <unk> in <unk> for two <unk> higher sales and low costs.
You know that today's School in average, give 45,000 products.
In a grocery store there are about 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the world is <unk> and it provides only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce on it.
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle the choices is David <unk> David <unk> the Harvard program.
Every Harvard employees are <unk> automatically to a insurance fund of life.
Who really wants to <unk> are offering you about 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how <unk>
All of them are <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that are between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they will not be able to do their <unk>
This evening, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience a few vacation with all paid the most good road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want the <unk>
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anyone who is ready to accept the deal.
They are not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that journey?
I think I actually got to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first <unk> that in the second, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the <unk> of choice which is <unk>
So that people understand the differences between choice, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very concrete ways.
Why is people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average, when they use debit cards or credit cards that when it uses a lot of time.
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And to that meeting that we would see exactly like <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was that we would give them to the staff to think about the positive things that they would spend in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent, and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a hall of magazines.
We saw that in the supermarket <unk> across the corridor of <unk> the magazines of magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the classification tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk> structures.
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know something?
This rating scheme is totally useless.
The categories must tell you something to <unk> not when the <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of funding.
I was supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can drive a lot more information than what we thought, if you just put it a little bit.
We need to increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a very good decision for a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that allows <unk> completely.
You have to take 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each one.
<unk> color outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is change the order in which the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go in a lot of choice, 56 colors, a few <unk> four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go in a few choice, four <unk> to 56 colors, many options.
And what about <unk>
What are you so involved in.
If you were <unk> the default button in every decision, this indicates you're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from many options to <unk> <unk> the <unk> button and again, and another more.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was to alter the order in which information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although the choice of changes don't say anything about the preferences of interior decoration.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more engaged us with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> alternative alternatives -- to make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've presented with were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who will work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful the <unk>
And the more careful we are in our choices better can be able to practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1960s in the East Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter to write it out to the government.
I had to register a piece of text from example written with the machine.
And this is so that the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a written with the wrong message, you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West, we don't think of someone who could do this, how much this is going to do, the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer in any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having a little printed little print on every page that makes them come from one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to have a lot of fun with this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three major causes of problems in the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world, we can put the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
Your mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks to win a lot of money, huge amounts of money.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, and <unk> and etc., etc.
These guys are doing their <unk> online but they do it by illegal means by <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a computer <unk>
The secret service of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this gentleman -- Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know your <unk>
And I say today is more likely to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most crimes we have online.
The second group of <unk> that we see today is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that the moves, they motivate them the protests, they motivate you the opinions, they motivate you laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have been <unk> over the last 12 months occupying a major role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals that do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who are doing for protest and the last group are the U.S. national governments that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is an authority of <unk> authority or, actually, it was.
<unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
You get the safety of the site and produce a <unk>
I was asked last week later, in a meeting with government representatives who asked one of the leaders if <unk> <unk> the death of people because of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die from an attack of these?
<unk> is an authority <unk>
<unk> <unk>
So what do we do <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we <unk> a foreign authority in the foreign authority.
And they will give them <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, the <unk> <unk> the headquarters of the British secret police headquarters in April 2011 and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was notes from a firm based on Germany who had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 44,000 euros to the <unk>
The company headquarters is right here.
That is, the Western governments provide the support governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, a couple of weeks ago, he found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officers to investigate their own citizens.
If you are <unk> in a criminal case -- well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But it's going to be more there.
They <unk> the Internet connection.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listening to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
So if we could be able to trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we're going to have today, will be forever.
<unk> blindly in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that we have to worry about in the next 50 years.
Here's where I live. I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, and behind the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park National Park has no fences in most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones who killed at night, and as soon as we grew up in the morning and found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> that we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value it.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
They were dying that they protect our community and cattle, and they are also mad with the problem.
So kill lions.
This is one of six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there are so few in the National Park of Nairobi.
A child in my community, in the age of six to nine years, is responsible for his father's livestock and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought of lions give them fear.
But I realized that actually this was not <unk> because it even helped the lions see the <unk>
I didn't give me <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
And he was trying to trick lions so they believed that I was close to the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were over, but the second day, and they said, this thing doesn't move, it's always here.  So he jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come from.
I discovered that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on which to turn the lights down.
And this is a little lamp from a <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell is the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity to the small box -- I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> give up the outside, because that's where the lions.
And this is how you see the lions when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never came to have trouble with lions.
And the houses in the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals, the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see the <unk> you can see in the background, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now throughout Kenya, <unk> to other predators like <unk> <unk> and it's also used to collect elephants from the farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise money and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and installed lights in the houses that do not have them, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a child in the disasters of the <unk> <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see airplanes and tell me that someday it would be inside one.
And I'm here today.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time at TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer for aviation and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You know, you don't picture what exciting is to hear a story like you.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electric <unk>
What's the next in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do one near electrical <unk> One near <unk>
<unk> I know that they have been invented fences -- but I want to do mine.
CA: You know, I read it once, like, <unk> and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: On the <unk> Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We go to <unk> at every step that I was going to do with my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "Don't <unk> anything."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we went out all the time studying Kim <unk> history, but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea are the enemies.
Even though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything changed <unk>
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution first.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and myself never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought a letter to my sister's colleague of my sister.
And he said, "When you get this -- the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We're <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're prepared to die."
I was very <unk>
I was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
At a short time, when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A living woman was dead on the street, holding a child <unk> in his arms looking at her mother's face without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine will <unk> North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only a few survived eating grass, insects and tree.
They also became more and more frequent <unk> all around me was completely dark at night except by the lights of the sea in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and us not.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea in the night compared to the other countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is the boundary between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river, at time.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for a short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee <unk>
But as soon as I learned that it's not just hard, but it's also dangerous, because North North China were considered illegal immigrants in China.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually made when I was arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> in the police station.
Somebody had accused me for being <unk> then I was able to put my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to be <unk>
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end up.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer said to another, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking at Oxford <unk>
But many of you can be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Even though the <unk> had been eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Each year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic than North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, everybody can be <unk> in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to be <unk> going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South Pole.
We're all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
Even through a identity.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that I could call my pride for me.
Even though I went to life in South Korea life was not easy, I did a plan. I started studying for the exam exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korea authorities had a little bit of money that sent my family, and as blame -- my family was going to be displaced to the force to a remote location in the <unk>
They had to run away.
I started planning how to make them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and <unk> to the border with North Korea.
Because my family could not speak to Chinese, I had to get them in a way, for over three thousand miles across China and then through east of Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and almost we were caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and addressed by a police officer.
He asked her to everybody. And he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who was <unk>
I looked at me, but I was fortunate to me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the <unk> border guards in <unk>
But even after switching the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated by crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and <unk> my family was released in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything for free to my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison in prison from South Korea.
I was going to go and come between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man asked, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would love to ask.
With my poor English and with a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and to get them to get them out of prison.
I read it with all my heart, and I asked her, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village to <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of stranger <unk> a new hope for me and for the people to be able to get it out of it.
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the international support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the people are <unk>
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieve their freedom is only half the battle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with a little bit or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice language practice practice and more.
We can also act like bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in contact with relatives still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Korea, a chance to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans -- all over the world, including at the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I live in South Pole.
This is <unk> <unk> stores of <unk> fast food, <unk>
So the city planners came together, and they thought, we're going to change the name of South South order to represent something else, so they changed to Los Angeles and South Africa, as if this is going to be wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles <unk>  <unk> of <unk> food, fast food, <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, alive in a food desert, Los Angeles <unk> home to the food places to take and eat in the car.
What was curious about is that the places of food to bring more people than food in the car.
People are dying of heart disease in Los Angeles South Pole.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times older than say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I think this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of house you see the effects that you see that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see chairs from wheels <unk> and sold as long cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this needs to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
I also got tired of driving 45 minutes back to buy an apple that doesn't have <unk>
What I did, it was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a <unk> strip we call a <unk>
It's 45 meters by 45 feet.
The point is that it belongs to the city.
But you have to <unk>
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me in win because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
That's how I decided to <unk>
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we put together and we started to plant our food forest -- trees -- you know, the nine <unk> vegetables, <unk>
What we do, we are kind of a group that was paid ahead of the gardeners of all the world's <unk> and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, I was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city came up with me, and <unk> gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> became <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
A court order for planting food on a piece of land that nobody <unk>  And then I was like, "Well, you know.
Because this time it wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk>
It has 68 miles of <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space for planting <unk> million <unk>
Why on earth does it don't like this?
<unk> a plant will give a <unk> 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars of a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Pole.
And I grew up there. It was my children there.
I was pleased to be part of this <unk> reality, which was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to get my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I culture my art.
Just as an artist from <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I use the garden, like a little bit of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> on that canvas.
You'd be surprised to see what the Earth can do, if you let it be their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a tool for education, transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You would be surprised to see how they affect guys.
<unk> is the most <unk> and provocative act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion that came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> at night and they were in my backyard, and I went out and look very <unk>
I, man, man, I felt bad as they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame at seeing people who were so close to me with hungry, and this only reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't temes that people are going to steal your <unk>
What I say, "Oh my God no, I don't fear you go to <unk>
So that's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to <unk> but at your time, I want you to get your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a <unk> shelter at the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how this had affected and how they used to plant her mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had a few people coming from, like 50 people come from, they work and <unk> all of them in a volunteer.
If the kids are growing up, the kids will eat <unk>
If you grow up <unk> they will eat <unk>  But if none of this will tell you, if you don't tell them how food affects your mind and the body, eat blind what they put them in front.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that you're hungry at, I see the color of color that are on this way that they designed for them, which doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids that are getting away from their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington, <unk>
But if we didn't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take <unk> and turn them into <unk>
I didn't care about it.
I'm not talking about free, because it's free not sustainable.
The funny thing about sustainability, it's you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is putting people back to people, getting the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, by opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want you all to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
You get them to pick up their <unk> okay?
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to see me, you won't call me the comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about making some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, you come into the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very <unk> road here.
It's made of <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days as it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt <unk>
And especially if they are going to go into your bicycle and these cars go back, that's not very nice.
In addition, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material and if we build roads, as in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a quiet road to be able to be a quiet road.
The solution for that is making roads of asphalt <unk>
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands, it has pores and water can go through it, so all the water water flows up to the sides and you will have a road that is easy to drive, and we don't have any water <unk>
The noise will also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very hollow, all the noise disappear, so it's a very silent road here.
It also has some <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> see that on this road the stones are <unk>
First one stone, then several more and more and more, and so on, and then -- well, and then -- well, I won't do that.  But you can hurt your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more damage.
Sometimes you can create <unk> with that.
Oh. It's ready.
<unk> of course, can be converted into a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see the damage in this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a little amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the <unk> light, the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they were <unk> they will become <unk> and separate from the <unk>
So if you drive on the road, you get the <unk> like we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think of materials from <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is to use <unk> of steel to clean up, and we can cut the steel wool into very small pieces and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with small pieces of steel in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, you use a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel is very good at it.
So what you need to do is they heat the steel to melt the <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and the stones will turn back to the surface.
I used a microwave oven, because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here on the stage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
We tested a lot of samples there and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So you donated a piece of road, 400 feet away from the <unk> <unk> where we had to do a test lane to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where the test test on the road, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We were doing a lot of the samples, we put a lot of payload on them, and then then with our <unk> machine and the best, and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using fibers of steel, incorporating these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, even they can double the life on the surface of the surface.
And now, of course, they're curious if this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
And actually, you have to cool first before I can show you how it acts repair it.
But I'm going to make a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember getting a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening BBC in his little gray radius.
He had a great smile on her face that it was unusual in those days, because the news is generally <unk>
<unk> was <unk> <unk> my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years ago when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and made the girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister that I could no longer be outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Each day, we would take a different route so that no one could be suspect where to do it.
We had to hide the books in the market bags so that it looks like we were shopping.
The school was at a house, more than 100 of us filled in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that <unk> our <unk> the teacher, the students and our parents.
Once in a while, school was suddenly suddenly a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about.
They were <unk>
Did you know where <unk>
We were <unk> but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> where his daughter, my mother, out to school, and so his father was doing it.
But my raised mother became a teacher.
This is her.
It was left two years ago, just to turn our house in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of all his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the <unk>
For him, there was a higher risk in not educating their children.
During the years of <unk> I remember there were moments that I was very frustrated with our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money, you can help you leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what is here, and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So, you still want to be <unk>
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than high school, and if my family would have been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from his home for the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He's not just <unk> from my university degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, and I carry it on the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador, and a global campaign to educate women.
It's why I cofounded <unk> the first one and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
What's exciting is I see students in my school with the strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like my friend, <unk> for them, despite the face of a <unk> opposition, in front of a <unk>
It's not the real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter were going on the way from <unk> to her village, and literally escaped to be killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, it's the phone, a voice noticed that if he kept sending his daughter to school, they would come back to try.
<unk> now, if <unk> said, "but not to harm the future of my old daughter and <unk> ideas."
What I've been aware of Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind the majority of those who <unk> there's a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers haven't been key to our success.
In fact, they're often the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who were to school told in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
I'm afraid that these changes wouldn't be a lot, after the retirement of U.S. troops in the U.S.
But when I look back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who are <unk> by them, that the <unk> I see a future <unk> and a <unk>
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities and <unk> and every day the girls of <unk> I was doing it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I'd never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you will never go into a revolutionary <unk>
It's almost two years since the <unk> revolution was inspired by the wave of mass <unk> both of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a big revolution.
Women and young men were in the <unk> <unk> the fall of regime, they are carrying <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
Have you shown a courage to copy the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> the way to the west to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and about 50 percent losses -- we managed to liberate our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've loved with a lot of other women, rebuilding civil society -- to rebuild a inclusive transition and just towards democracy and the national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation for democracy.
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> for and immediately after the fall of <unk> roughly 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm -- I started to organize workshops about the development of capacities and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> by the Peace -- a movement of women, leaders of <unk> <unk> to advocate for the women's autonomy of the woman and for our right of participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was getting more and more <unk> and <unk> of the selfish policies of domination, and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won a <unk> of National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, little bit, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day in a violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques old and <unk>
Another day with the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their abuses of human rights from prisoners and their lack of respect for law.
Our society, made out of a <unk> mindset -- and it gets away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had at the beginning.
<unk> and <unk> became the icon of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here at all about <unk> with our history of success of <unk> <unk> and elections.
I'm right here today to say that we, as a nation, and we choose wrong, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't bring peace and stability and safety to Libya.
The <unk> list and the <unk> between candidates and 1970, brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination, and <unk> both for men for women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creating consensus more than we needed the election, that just <unk> the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of the female more than it needs to need for <unk> and quantitative representation of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call <unk>
We need to begin to act like compassion and for mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, not only <unk> but also to put the mercy in the place instead of <unk> collaboration instead of competition, inclusion and <unk>
These are the ideals that one Libya, devastated by war, desperately needs the end to reach peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between the female perspectives and the male <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all of the <unk> traditions -- it has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> which involves all the humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all the tribes have <unk>
And so just like the uterus covers completely <unk> which grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion is <unk> all of the existence.
This is how he tells us, "My mercy is all of things."
This is how it tells us, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
Which is all about the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a optimistic question, which has an equally <unk> answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is that everybody is doing a very good thing. Why is she left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who would <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, no student in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to count.
I was 22 years old, he had been <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green American <unk> and had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I creates my soul -- <unk> me to the head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man who loved anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a neonatal <unk> <unk> where every year millions of women, and even some men.
Until your story.
I don't look like a survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies with <unk> <unk> <unk> between them, and Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been nearly 20 years old, married my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all of the race, all of the religions, all the levels of income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> <unk> and <unk> or, in the families, the last place where we would want or we would expect to find <unk> reason for which, domestic abuse, is so puzzling.
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would be left with a man who sticks with it, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
It was 22 years old, and in the United States women in the ages of 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands in the United States.
I also was a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold, rain night in January.
I was sitting next to my side in the New York City and he started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a college of <unk> <unk> and I was working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me most about that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that seemed like a <unk> guy.
He had a little bit of big <unk> as apples and <unk> and a <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things he made from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of a mate.
He did it about everything in the beginning of a <unk>
We started getting out and loved everything from me: I was ready to go to Harvard who would put a passion to help young girls and my job.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and a woman, as nobody had ever done it.
And it was why the bachelor's in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any treatment of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York City and let my work for my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I <unk> I quit my job and <unk> and I went into Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering a <unk> and financial trap. and psychological and very carefully <unk>
The next step in the side of domestic violence is to introduce violence threat to see how it reacts it.
And here is where those <unk> are coming in.
As soon as we moved to New England -- you know, that place where you are supposed to be so sure that I was so safe to bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another he kept under the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said I needed those guns to cause from their trauma that lived from a small trauma.
I needed it to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me and even though I had never taken me my hand, my life already was serious danger, every minute every day.
The first physicist attack was five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, then I put the girlfriend suit. I got married with him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we were living happy forever, because I loved it, and he loved it.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just had felt very <unk> by the wedding and the fact of making a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I would never make any harm.
I spent two times more on our moon.
The first time I was driving to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I would spend several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving back from our honey moon -- they went through the traffic and threw a Big Mac <unk> to the face.
<unk> followed one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I thought that was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or harassment at some time in their life, and the Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had a very good company.
Going back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> <unk> to face their <unk>
The other question that everybody is doing is, why don't you just get <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have been at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and agonizing question that people do, because us, the victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the brain of domestic violence is kill her.
More than 70 percent of the killings in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim to end the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include the permanent harassment -- even after the <unk> has become married, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family justice system for <unk> to the victim and their children, who are normally forced by judges to spend time <unk>
And yet we continue to figure out why it is simply not low.
I was able to <unk> because of a last <unk> beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if it would have allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told the entire world: the police, my neighbors, my friends and family and family, complete unknown, and I'm here today because I all <unk>
We have the trend to <unk> victims of the victims like headlines -- <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why are you <unk>
For some people is a way to say <unk> is by <unk> as if the victims <unk> intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also have learned that they learned a representative lesson from what happened to them and that they will transcend their lives and joyful and happy lives as <unk> wives and mothers, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence, very typical violence.
I went back to marry a guy and kind of kind of and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to come back to ever have more, ever is a <unk> gun pointing to my head in someone who says that I want.
So at this moment, you are thinking, <unk> -- that's <unk> or <unk> which stupid but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you there are a few people who are listening to me right now, who are being <unk> or they were being <unk> or they were <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting their daughter, to their sister, their best friend right now.
I was able to end up my crazy love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing this today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> thrives only in silence.
They have the power of ending domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
We need the victims of the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the <unk> of the light talking about it with their children, their colleagues and family and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors as fantastic people and <unk> who have a future future.
<unk> the active signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims of a safe <unk>
Together, we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. My name is Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years.
And I feel that at this point there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed it like this.  luckily, I've brought them clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women were <unk> when they die, they don't have to do it now, but I find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think of in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to pass this sweater through the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything as long as my head covers me.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that not as much as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but also <unk>
I have completely changed what they thought about six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
And the photographer was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I was going on my back, and he <unk> the hair.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one that I made two days ago for work, there are very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, even though shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's going to be a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but in a <unk> way.
The first question is, how does it come to be model?
And I always say, a <unk> I discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made it model is because I won the genetic lottery, and I'm a <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we've also associated with a high and <unk> shape, to <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> I've known to leverage money to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> who are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> for how much models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York City told all of the models in the <unk> and of the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- it's less than four percent, they were not white <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is: Does it be a model when <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't know that.
But then what I would tell you to every one of these girls is, why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a professional surgeon would say, <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, as you were the first.
If after this spectacular list is still <unk> No, no, <unk> -- I want to be a model, then I know I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the head of the American magazine or the <unk> executive director or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you have to be a model is like saying that you want to win the lottery when you're higher.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you get your studies, you have a plan and you have a plan and a little bit of your back, no matter what you would do, you know, if you want to be president of the United States, but your plan will be <unk> 32 of clothes inside for 10 years, people would be surprised.
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a little girl.
So I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the photos for the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not in those photos.
They are <unk> from a group, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and people in <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is to do things for free?
I have too many 19-year-old <unk> and I never use, except the couple before, but the privilege I get -- I get the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped a red light in red and, of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent in order to be able to follow <unk>
<unk> of these privileges for me, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their way no matter who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year, from the teenagers who are couple and <unk> 86 percent were black and Latino -- and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk>
It's how many times it would be <unk>
When I investigate this talk, I found out that after 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of an model?
And I think the answer you're expecting is, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the most brilliant hair, you will feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful travel, and also amazing to be able to work with creative people, clever and <unk>
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm <unk>
And I'm because I have to worry about my day every day.
And if you ever ask you, if you ever ask you, with some more thin legs and the most brilliant hair, I will be <unk>
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs -- the brightest hair and the clothes, but probably the <unk> women are physically <unk>
But mostly it was difficult to look at a situation of race and gender oppression when I am one of the greatest <unk>
If there's something to retain from this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable by recognizing the power of the image of the image that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was much greater enough to support a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 <unk> pictures -- and I didn't get the <unk>
There was no <unk> <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum minimum in the lighting of lighting.
And in fact, most of them take them tourists random.
My story starts when I was in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and five.
He had the chance we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you to <unk> New York on a <unk> trip and you drive the <unk>
So here is when we started asking the tourists that they were going to take us through the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has been denied and fortunately, never nobody has <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much it would change the life of this journey.
It became something sacred to us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day as a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than some concrete moment or a specific journey.
They are also a way to stop the time in October week, and we think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we get the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how they perceives and interacting with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something we hope for the whole year.
Recently, in one of the travel, we were walking, when suddenly, he stopped in dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the tent that would be <unk> from small in the previous visits to the <unk>
And I described to me what had a sense of the five years standing in that same place.
<unk> who remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what looks at New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York City.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is memories.
So, I want to share the idea of actively engaging in conscious of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one who pulls the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and I don't want to go on to somebody else and ask him, get a <unk>
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the <unk> group of <unk>
First of all, why are they so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughs as a stupid dumb characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament <unk> But I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
They hardly be <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World who are mostly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the World Bank -- where we have 16 species.
So why are the ones that are important -- first of all, they provide physical services to <unk>
They're our natural trash <unk>
<unk> the cadavers up to the bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria to absorb the anthrax that not being because they would spread and cause great losses to livestock and disease in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where the cadavers are taking three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have a huge historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture.
<unk> was the symbol of lip and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between <unk> and <unk> Egypt.
In the Hindu mythology -- <unk> was the god <unk> and <unk> his life to save the <unk> <unk> the Tasmanian <unk>
In <unk> culture, they're doing a very important <unk> to open sky in places like <unk> there's no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason you're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical list, of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years <unk> and the reason is because they fall prey from livestock consumption that has been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned by veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Because there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of <unk> dogs in <unk> and when you have dogs dogs -- you have a huge pump of time to <unk> the number of rage has increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be above Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind power, but we need to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds. They cut them in half.
They are <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're investigating these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel by different countries, so we can focus on a public problem is not going to serve anything.
We need to work with governments in the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can you help? It can become active -- make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you get out of this room, you will tell you about <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors about <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw it fly without <unk> <unk> in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Each thing I do -- and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work for my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young people, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa de <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a <unk> NGO and every project that we set up in Sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
They went to the 21, which Italians were good people and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of everything that we were doing was <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people about Zambia to grow food.
So we came up with the seeds of the southern Zambia of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that goes down to the <unk> River, and we teach the locals growing tomatoes Italians and <unk> and ...
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, because of what they were interested in to come to work, and sometimes they didn't go to <unk>  We were amazed that the local in so fertile valley, they didn't have agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that I was not <unk> anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here."  <unk> time to save the people from Zambia from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa became <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> In Italy, a tomato would grow to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> "Look at how easy it is <unk>
When tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red and the red morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have farming here."  "Why don't you get it? "You're never <unk>
I thought only of us Italians <unk> mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what Americans, they were doing -- what the teacher did, and then to see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
We were going to see the <unk>  <unk> see the waste that they would give them to the <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, countries, Western countries, we've given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the harm that that money has ever been.
Just read your book.
<unk> from a African woman -- the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries -- and we treat people only about two things: or the <unk> or we are <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture as if they were my children, "I want you a lot."
<unk> I try to all of them in a different culture like my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The little thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said for all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> they were going on their own.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the floor and said, we can -- you can just imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided for 27 years just to respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you never motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? You <unk>
You never get to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a cafe and we met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's going to do you?
The passion that she has for his own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that the man has to have for their own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we helped them find the knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years old, and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for one time instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not for one time, they <unk> But not on <unk> meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with <unk> meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance have been <unk>
So, planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't go to their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work on face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor in the business -- who stands up with you in his house, at the table of his kitchen, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this garbage -- <unk> where we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects, and the government came to me to see how you can do that?
How can I do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
And so the government says, <unk> <unk>  So the government says, <unk> <unk>   So we've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> in history, passed away '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before being involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of death from the death of business.
So now we <unk> reconstructing <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to get to talk to you with you.
You have to give you privacy, privacy, it has to be fantastic to the help and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What am you going to show you more this tomorrow?
<unk> local people. That's what you have <unk>
So, what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution, the fossil revolution, <unk> <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we need to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an amazing story that I read in a magazine magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> he met this group of people, and they would talk about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't be within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is going to be growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in <unk>  So, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that we would <unk> New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years in 1900, in 1900, in the United States <unk> <unk> companies <unk> <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise they won't come to talk to you.
Then, you have to give you absolute <unk> <unk>
And then you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the biggest company has to be able to do three things: the product that you want to sell is to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic marketing and you have to have a fantastic financial administration.
Do you know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that I can do to sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at the <unk> of the 100 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Ford, all of new companies -- Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: None of it was started by one person.
Never word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
Nobody starts a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in <unk> in <unk> and <unk> who will do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who was talking about this <unk> someone who speaks to you, what will you need?
What can you do? Can you do it?
Okay, you can see it -- you can look at the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do it." <unk> who seeks <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors -- so we don't change a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a <unk>
How do you share more memories from our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share our hopes for the cows in the cows so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> which give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It's always going to accommodate music.  There's a <unk> in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one with the most <unk> <unk>
I live close to this house and thought about how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and age.
And this gave me a deep gratitude for the lived time.
He told the significant things about my current life.
But I tried to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to get to catch a day on day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant board and painted on her sentences for <unk> "Before they die <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was full and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
"Before I die, I want to be tested by <unk>  Before I die I want to sit on the line of <unk>
Before I died, I want to sing for millions of people."
"Before I die, I want to plant a <unk>
"Before I die, I want to live outside of the <unk>
"Before I die, I want to spend it once more."
"Before I died, I want to go to the rescue of <unk>
"Before I die, I want to be completely myself."
This space has been a constructive space, and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort at hard moments of tough moments.
It's about knowing that one is not alone. It's trying to understand our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's trying to accommodate the reflection and the <unk> and of remembering what is most important for us as we grow and we change it.
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center, we did a kit and now have been used in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if we give ourselves the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things that we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distractions to be increasing, it's more important than ever, to find the ways to keep the perspective and to remember life is very short and fragile.
The death is something that we often avoid talking, or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that give us more power.
You think about death -- our life.
Our spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as a community and more media to share hopes and fears and stories, the people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have one request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> is 22 years old, it's high and very <unk>
We don't talk about, but it brings joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
He shares it <unk> what's going on.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and look at this: it's never <unk>
When I sing songs from our childhood, trying to talk the words that I didn't even know -- it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very <unk>
<unk> the more <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that he came up with each of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the birthday of Lady <unk>
It doesn't like amazing?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the <unk> concept of society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case -- although you wouldn't consider them inside of the <unk> that could only mean one thing: which were autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes to physical skills.
In every single individual it manifests itself a different way -- where it would be so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, are diagnosed with a new case of autism, and although it's one of the development of development that goes faster in the world, there is no cause no <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When they spent a few months, I realized he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play as the other babies and in fact, didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived in their own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars in line around the room, looking at the machine and eat anything that would have <unk>
As I grew up, it becomes more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature -- a child who looked at the world without <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments where I wish they were fair like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that would not want to change the normal.
<unk> passes the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It only means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could imagine, one thing to <unk> and Sam and you would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that are <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in your inside and honestly, the pursuit of normal is the ultimate <unk>
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change in the moment where we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what has been to be <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a teacher from communications, who gave a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> of real <unk> of these students with their great minds -- their great books and their great and unknown words.
But when those conversations, I felt what it would have had felt when he fell through the <unk> and saw the door of a new world.
And so I felt like I had these conversations with the students. I was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to the environment and health care of health, between others, and if we don't know what we do or understand about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our engineers and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that their science is sexy and the engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us that we study the <unk> but they study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing their science, careful with the <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as making them dumb things.
Instead, as Einstein, said everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting your work, forget about the signs of <unk>
They have asked why they're called <unk>  What do they do <unk> <unk> kill, and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's being <unk> too much in the language of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that actually inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then it will provide graphs that we will turn to our other senses and create a sense more profound sense of understanding what it was <unk>
I think these are just some key ones that can help the others open the door and see the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English English is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an editor <unk> from the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that he searches for a public charge no matter -- platform or start, and when he won, it gets him for the mere use of monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
One thing to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the foundation in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the early name of <unk> <unk> who faced the <unk>
He brought her into the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end, he had a popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's a literal way.
It's not. It's a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
You didn't know it.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were presented with all kinds of suggestions that might be <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> of the North America.
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about quality.
And they didn't even have the idea that you could be elected King for a given date.
And there might be <unk>
Everyone got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused <unk> and <unk> was that the House of <unk> was against <unk>
<unk> House didn't want Washington to be <unk>
They didn't want to call it a King of if it was just giving him or his realization to him or his foremost.
So they wanted to give the title more <unk> more <unk> and more <unk> that came into them.
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invented the title. There was only before, but it only meant <unk> that we would have a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was a <unk> of small <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but really was a insignificant.
And so the Senate <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who would be serious about a title of such ridiculous title, as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't know.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out the Senate has never been <unk> as the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep out there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that one measure is <unk>  <unk> possible to keep ourselves waiting for more years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this I want to tell you, is that the President of President of America doesn't sound so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads at disposal, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of aerial vehicles and so on.
The reality and history have endowed with the title of <unk>
So finally, he won the <unk>
They got his title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was an uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy in the 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So, at the end the Senate won and the House of <unk> <unk> because nobody is going to feel humble when you tell them that they're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and I want to <unk>
The politicians try to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but actually the reality changes a lot more the words than these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to feet underground in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak about, but especially that cacophony of <unk> male and stones were with <unk> tools.
Like others, I carry a cheap <unk> of light -- she supports his head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the branches of the walls that hold up the walls of that hole that would fall hundreds of feet on the ground.
And I turned out my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met a few days earlier, who lost control and fell several feet in that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep stage of that hole, at the end of their lives without paying a reward and often dying.
I went out of that hole, and I went home, but they may never help them, because they're prey from slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> at the <unk> Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there was a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO that has been made to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was the world but not that grade.
When we finished talking, I was very bad -- honestly I was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days, and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me <unk> the stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of the <unk> the <unk> and he offered my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in a lot of these places.
Some of them even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans all over the <unk> <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a young farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 years today.
However, you can help all entire families for generations per generation for <unk> <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates profits from over 13 billion dollars a year across the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises and better work and better work to find that they are forced to work without pay, under violence threat and they can't escape.
Now the slavery operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
<unk> exists in almost everyone and yet it's illegal to all over the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange <unk> show was like entering the old Egypt or <unk> <unk>
<unk> at a temperature of 54 degrees <unk> men, women, kids, in fact, entire families -- <unk> in a heavy <unk> <unk> <unk> mechanically mechanically mechanically bricks in their head, until 18 at the time, and they carry them from <unk> <unk>
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee to eat, and you had no drink, and the severe <unk> made it <unk>
And so <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run to the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
And I wanted to cry I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was next to me very quickly, grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly that to show emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct aid.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I was not a citizen of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation than they were gone.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working within the system for her release and trusted that I was doing it.
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found kids carrying stones for miles per <unk> <unk> to trucks who were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were a lot of heavy than the children who had charge and children would put them to their heads with <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all their life.
You have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers break their freedom, the <unk> had been completely their houses.
When you hear the word <unk> often we often think about sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness that would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk>
It led me to a little bit of <unk> <unk> which gave this <unk> <unk> <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was more a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they're local to prostitution <unk>
They have small rooms and private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of that only seven years -- they're forced to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of them is dark and <unk> identified by a number of painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their customers.
On the <unk> I remember making sense of absolute <unk> and, in that instant, I could barely imagine what it must be <unk> on that hell.
I just had a <unk> on the stairs where they <unk>
There was no doors <unk>
There were no windows big enough to <unk>
Those people have no <unk> and you want to touch a topic that is so hard, it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of <unk> people in agriculture, <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as a sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often related to <unk> labor.
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families in which entire families would go into the silk trade.
This is a family family.
The black hands of black are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope we could be able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we came there, I went to get a quick look.
I saw what it seemed to be a mother of fishermen in a boat, two older brothers, some younger kids, and it makes sense, right?
They were <unk>
The children are separated from their <unk> families and they were forced to work <unk> <unk> on these boats in the lake, despite not knowing how to swim.
This boy has eight years old.
When our boat came up to him was a little bit to me that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The branches of the trees were <unk> in Lake <unk> and often trap networks and children, <unk> and with fear, it gets to the water to release the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
By fear of his love is not going to run out, and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> it is the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning when they were looking at the last networks, but they had been working from the one of the one of the one.
On the cold night and <unk>
And it will actually point out that these networks are more than 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes is possible.
Who will be because someone decided to make the difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with <unk> partners -- the <unk> a fellow <unk> with her suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and he played the window.
It asked us to do it by a land path to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we got to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to come up quickly.
Then you signal this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
As we started to slow down, we removed the <unk> that the path and after walking around a time we found the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the photos of photos on my head as they were <unk> in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> road ended up <unk> in one of the <unk> and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a football camp -- and they were all filled with workers.
A lot of women had children tied to their back, and while they were looking for gold, <unk> in the waters of <unk> <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> have to be 90 feet to 90 feet and these people carry on heavy heavy baby bags that then will be shipped to another area where they <unk> the stone to get the gold.
A site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look more closely at it, the margin is going to work at other less lucky and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> would end up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died his uncle took him to work with him in mines.
When he died his uncle, <unk> I had the debt of the uncle as the force to be slave in mines.
When I met her, I had worked in 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so serious that doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and nonetheless, it's forced to work on night and day in that mine.
Yet, he has been to be liberated and <unk> with local activists as <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, from face to a remote, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
They knew that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we'll get witness to them and that we will do everything to help change their lives.
<unk> I think if we can see each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not magazines. They are real people, real people, like you and me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day to happen that I don't think about these so many beautiful people, <unk> that I've had the great honor to meet.
And I hope that these images wake up a force where you can see them in people like you, and I hope that force turn on a fire and that fire <unk> light over slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math math and there's a particular problem for whom we are <unk> we are like the management centers.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  that we'll see later on.
But the demand for a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity and probably some <unk> <unk> that well can have a genetic component that you can have a genetic component of training.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at the time was a ballet ballet <unk>
Over the last few years has made a lot of progress on the treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world that are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in an objective way and ultimately, the only way we can know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective metric and an objective <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological <unk> so they don't serve the blood analysis, and the best we have is a neurological <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of the clinical trials never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic -- what if patients could be asked to do ourselves?
It won't be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is, as a very conventional way to try, you see, in a certain sense at least we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of the vibrating strings.
It shows someone in the same while it makes sounds like a little bit about, Can we imagine how dancers of a vocal <unk> because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs, to produce sound and all of us have the genes that are needed.
And, like <unk> it requires a remarkable training.
Let's think about the time that takes a child learning to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as <unk> and as the Parkinson's disease affects the <unk> also affects the <unk> organs.
On the bottom plot you can see an example of the irregular shake irregular strings.
We see the same <unk>
shake <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> both uses existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole range of hospitals to do it.
Both of them are precise. All right, but also the test scores are not <unk>
I mean, you can be <unk>
They're very quickly, they take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They are very minimal cost and we all know what happens.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it goes on massive scale.
These are some incredible goals to help address.
We can reduce the <unk> <unk>
I would not have to go to the clinic for the <unk> of routine.
With high <unk> we could get <unk>
We could make it massive <unk> <unk> for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So by giving you the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to tackle these goals.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or no disease, I can call it low price and leave recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.  Tom Rielly: So I would try and take all these samples of, say 10,000 people, you'll be able to say who's healthy and who isn't it?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease.
<unk> You can see, some people can not <unk> You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of data in different circumstances, and doing it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the factors of confusion in pursuit of the real markers of disease.
TR: You have a <unk> accuracy at this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my graduate student, I have to <unk> it has done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works in the mobile phone network as well, what we have -- the project -- we now have about accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> audience.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March from 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
Are we creatures <unk> gray.
We were <unk> in the darkness, in <unk> and we usually avoid sunlight.
We do the <unk> models even more <unk> the perfect skin -- even more perfect, we can do the impossible, and we would have been involved in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent many years of experience and the photograph of the images and photography.
On March 11, I saw from my house, like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Soon time later, an organization where I was <unk> where <unk> <unk> was in the room working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers knew that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13 of May traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village located in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The water level over 24 feet tall and over three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
<unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools, we removed the mud and we left the lists to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons of tons and tons of dead fish, <unk> <unk> of the local factory.
We loved it, and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> pictures and cameras and <unk>
Everyone did the same thing.
<unk> and take them into different places of villages around <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they went from <unk> and to save their lives, they had to abandon everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a heart center of the town.
It helped clean up the Great toilets, giant <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of the <unk> <unk> the photos.
And so I took them and I had the honor that day <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard the expression to think beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until beyond myself my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years old, some were still in the laboratory, I couldn't help but think about how to fix that <unk> how to fix that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I went into Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I was not too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl -- I had a lot of precision and <unk>
In the other way, that little girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over time, they came up with a little bit more <unk> and they needed more <unk> so I went into Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
And after two weeks I had 150 people who were <unk>
In Japan in July, we gave us a town a town to the north of <unk>
Once we use the week we use our scanner in the time agencies that were <unk> where people were going to claim their photos.
The time that we were going on in <unk> is a different story, it depended on some of the photos.
It could be an hour. It could be <unk>
It could be a months.
This <unk> had to draw in a lot of hand using a guide the areas whose color and detail was not destroyed.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures of <unk> in saltwater, covered with bacteria, with algae, and even with oil -- all of that over the time I continue to <unk> that by hand was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the photo unless it was clean dry and <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky to <unk>
We have a <unk> guide to a <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more the photos already <unk>
As he once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman brought us these pictures had been lucky in relation to the photos.
He had started <unk> she was just stopped by realizing that they would get them even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not have been able to <unk> we were able to put the pictures in a single picture, and they would get the whole picture.
When he collected his pictures shared something about her story with us.
A colleagues of her husband found the photos in a fire station between the rubble quite far away from where she used to be their house, but their colleagues would <unk>
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Her young children, not as small now, but their two children were at school, in different schools.
One of them was caught in the water.
He took a week to find her entire family and know that they all had survived.
The day I gave her her photos his son under 14 years.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could do -- something that he could remember to look at, something I could remember from the past day when everything in my life changed or was destroyed.
After six months after six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined -- hundreds of them helped to clean out more <unk> photographs -- the great majority of <unk> -- the vast majority went into their <unk> <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring back to 90 families hundreds of pictures of completely <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we actually don't spend more than 1,000 in teams and materials, most of the ink to <unk>
We took pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one place, a relationship, somebody loved it.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing we would wear but the first thing that we would want to look for.
This is about the project to restore small bits of humanity, to give someone their connection to the past.
When a picture comes back to somebody, somebody is a huge difference in the life of the person that comes in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected to something larger, will give up something, using their talent to something that aren't thin models of perfect skin.
To finish up I'd like to read this email -- I sent him Cindy day I came back from Japan after six months.
While <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, <unk> around a baby, and I was scared because a very similar picture of my family, my mother, me and my newborn daughter <unk> on our wall.
In the whole world in all the very few of our basic needs are the same. Right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us to wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet going through an apple in one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion or a billion frames per second.
I give you a new kind of <unk> a new technique technique that can create video in slow motion of the light in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or seeing the inside of the body without the <unk> and really challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser laser, and you will switch on it and put it into a <unk> of a second or a second or a whole package of photons to create a <unk> package of just one millimeter long.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a common bullet than a commons.
If we took that bullet and this package of photons and fire in this bottle, how do you disperse those photons into this <unk>
What is the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all this --  -- remember, all of this is actually happening in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola doesn't have this research --  -- <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a <unk> package that starts to <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Some of the light is going to be <unk> and we started to see these <unk>
A lot of photons finally hit the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that bounces inside the inside.
And at that time, the waves travel on the table, and because of the thoughts of the top you see on the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights are <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and the current and we make it <unk> the same distance and we see it in slow motion.
A day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring film --  of a slow bullet in motion.
And what about testing nature <unk>
You can see the waves that are <unk> from the table, the tomato and the wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a photo, I thought of a <unk> at once, but of course, our eyes see a <unk> composition of it.
But if you look once more and more <unk> you'll realize that, as the light gets <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces inside its inside and it goes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your phone, you'll be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is grown without having to touch it.
Why do we create this camera at <unk>
As photographers, you know, if we took a picture of a little exhibition, it goes very little light.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the shortest show -- so I just will get some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded one and again with a very <unk> <unk> we took these data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data on a raw data, and we can make it interesting.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, can become invisible, they can become invisible,
And if a new power of a better future would allow him to do after <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You can go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera to the camera.
So we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We have built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a tiny fraction of photons will return to the camera, but interestingly, in a slightly different time.
And as we have a camera that works like this fast, our <unk> has unique abilities.
It has very good figures and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects -- but we don't know what point corresponds to what a distance.
By projecting a laser -- you can record a picture of the <unk> which, you see on the screen, it doesn't really have any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, tens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try to look at the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we'll be able to see the object.
Can we see it in <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's around the curve.
Or we could find survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at the light reflected by open miles.
Or we could build <unk> that can be able to see the inside of the body by using <unk> and the same thing for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and blood this is quite hard, so this is actually an order to the scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new form of visualization to solve problems in health care problems in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he became a scientist, I became science in art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all the data <unk> that we collected every time is not just for scientific visualizations but we can see it.
And create a new computer picture form with slow motion and code.
And look at those waves, remember, the time between each of those waves is only about a few <unk> of a second.
But here is also a fun thing to do.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going on from us.
<unk> should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out that as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, Einstein would have delighted to see this image.
The order in which the events happen in the world sometimes occurs to the camera.
<unk> the corresponding <unk> of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
That's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> life, and gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, and I'll get it to <unk> and become famous.
This is all possible with a mobile.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this town.
Here you can see the hundreds of thousands of people who are looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people who are going to come out for a change, have a mobile phone in my pocket.
Who of us have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone.
<unk> a Android, a Blackberry, <unk>
It's a lot. Almost everyone has a mobile phone.
But today I will talk about me, from my mobile, and how my life changed.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
Oh.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. introduced a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This message says that every European telephone company, every single Internet vendor in all Europe, has to store a wide range of information range of users.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and until two years, in their phone company or your Internet provider or the Internet.
And in all Europe people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this scores of data.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone <unk> and the Internet suppliers and all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of Berlin and said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of you even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret law of East Asia.
And I also asked me if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> that at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, which please get me through all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to him, and I didn't get a concrete answer, and I didn't get a concrete answer.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to give you a demand for court because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end of the end, it <unk>
I prescribe the demand and they would send me the information that I would have.
Meanwhile, the <unk> <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing about brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the beginning I saw it and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I spend night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information to <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open comes in, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and <unk> go back and forwards.
You can see every step I give up.
And you can see how I'm going to get a train <unk> and what often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
But of all of us.
First, there are things like, like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talk a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call it between them.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how your people communicate with each other to what time they call each other to what time you sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks about who, who sends him an email to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets in Berlin, in the 1989, they had a mobile phone in my pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall might never have happened.
And as a result, not the fall of <unk>
Because today, business agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible within and outside the web.
They want to have the chance to follow our lives and they want to help them forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital era is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When they go back home, tell their friends that privacy is a 21st-century value, and it's not <unk>
When you go home, tell your representative that only because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones that will give them to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
I call it <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> the poor in the process.
As a result of a result, I have cerebral palsy, so we would get it all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> you can't <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were identical to siblings, although they are.
It's only about accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration and I don't want any of you to be there.
I feel bad for me, because at some point in life, you've wanted to be disabled.
Let's go for a walk.
Christmas Christmas are at the shopping center, drive in circles for parking lot and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I say, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There's a <unk> of <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a Palestinian rich, woman, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you might have to do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same initial experience.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, I would.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was: "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters were <unk> I was born.
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents would go to the school system and were <unk> that I was also outside -- and if we didn't take all the ultimate note.
My father taught me to walk at the five years by putting my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another approach that I used was to hang on a dollar in front of me so that you can do it.
The <unk> that I carry in it was very strong and and and and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking as a <unk> champion who has received many <unk>
Growing up, there were six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arab and still all of the family.  I think nobody realized we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and the politicians thought appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as <unk>
The people who grew up with no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be <unk> a lot of hunger for <unk>
I told them that he had enough fat to live three months without eating them, so you get the dawn at sunset so it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I too.
And when my friends were going to spend summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not coming.
I was spending my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we don't go back to Palestine -- all the <unk> are <unk>
On summer vacation often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> and they were going to get me close cups on the back, and I remember <unk> in the <unk> Sea and I remember the water <unk> me and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before I do yoga it was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can get it in your head.
My parents had this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a grant for the University of Arizona, University of the state of Arizona, because I went in all the <unk>
It was like the pet <unk> of the theater.
Everyone <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the ultimate note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene of my crystal zoo my teachers <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow <unk>
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> he finally got a <unk>
I have paralysis <unk>
At the end of the end of <unk>
Thank God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running the director of the theater, crying to the theater department crying as if someone had killed my cat, ask her why and she told me why and she told me that because they thought I couldn't do the risk stunts
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk stunts I can't do the <unk>
It was a role for the which literally had been born and was given to an actress without <unk>
The college was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors with a disabled papers.
I graduated back home, and my first tour was <unk> it was as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They just give perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of these women had one thing in common. They were <unk>
So I did <unk>
In my first tour I was carrying famous comics from New York to New Jersey, and never forget the face of the first story that he took when he landed on the realization that he was at high speed by the New Jersey highway with a driver that had <unk>
I worked in clubs all over the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little rumor that the women are not fun, and we find it very fun.
In 2003, my mother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Film Festival in New York City, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of <unk> in media and remind you to remind the <unk> <unk> that <unk> and Arabs are not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier than fighting the challenge of stigma disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the cable news program behind me with Keith <unk>
I walked out of a graduate dance, I went to a study and sat down to a studio <unk>
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I was clinging to the news desk to not go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was just like <unk> and hit my chair.
Something fun that I learned in the direct Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It tells you that kids are <unk> but they never fall away from me or older as a little girl.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became a <unk> object.
I'd see clips online with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It is <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What does it have?
We really should pray for it.
A little suggested suggested even I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't do it <unk> then you can't make someone in <unk>
<unk> are -- yeah, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said they didn't survive, but I'm here in front of you.
However, I have grown up with media, I don't think it <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hatred in the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need all the society to teach our children.
My journey has led me to a very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I came to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world, <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give kids to Palestinians Syrian refugee children, a small small part of what my parents would do.
It was the only time my father saw me acting in live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
It lives in a little town to South <unk>
This people are close to <unk>
<unk> drives small people to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without nothing for him there, it's going to the great city, in this case, <unk> <unk> capital.
When you get there, there are no opportunities, no work, or <unk>
He ended up in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day you give him a man who offers him to <unk> after dinner, to <unk>
It meets a dynamic group of people, which gives him a break.
He gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home to your family.
He presented to a young boy.
They finally get home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky <unk> a bomb.
That child in that little village with the dreams of the big city was the <unk> terrorist and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a connected organization with al Qaeda.
So how does the story of a little boy trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start their future, waiting for a perspective of future, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that came out of what we call the <unk> period.
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young unemployed urban young unemployed riots who were <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, which seek something beyond <unk> <unk>
For young people, the great dream of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for jobs work, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
Often it's youth, which suffers from the highest rates of <unk>
By 2030, three of five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include the young people in the growth of our cities, if we didn't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terror, to violence, to <unk> will be the story of cities.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people is <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They don't see anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember being in front of that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, "Well, if I had never gone?
And if I had seen forced to be in that same <unk> of <unk>
It would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to meet juvenile leaders at a business altitude.
They went to about 90 juvenile leaders.
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, that because he was a graduate graduate company, frustrated, was the perfect white <unk> for <unk> and other Afghan organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to the point A to the B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war, have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way of <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a <unk> company.
It started <unk> they were blown away to local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this different?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think the entrepreneurial spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
They gave young people to be the creators of the economic opportunity that are looking for so expensive.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was reluctant to train some of the young people at the height of business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business enterprise.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from abroad.
If you ask somebody, "When was the last time you saw <unk> flowers.
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard climate <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for weddings and creating gardens in the houses, and the companies in the city, and now it's working in the creation of the first public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he's not grown.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their history, their innovation, actually had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
The encouraged to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that they could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So to inspire young people and create a entrepreneurial spirit culture, is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and orientation to <unk> in development and put it out of their businesses.
They gave young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support that they need to move from conception to creation, and will create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the entrepreneurial spirit is something more than start a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed isn't just by selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Peace Park is how he calls it, when he's created, when it's created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired children from the street to help rent to rent and keep <unk> for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and <unk> their <unk> innovation, and you will have more stories about flowers and Parks of the Peace <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> a <unk> area in the state of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest.
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and it's not going to be on the way that we <unk> almost we can pretend that we were the first human beings on board that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with sight to a beautiful opaque lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts -- <unk> balls of aluminum and old.
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> that were too lazy as to pull out what they had <unk> who thought it was going to clean up their <unk>
That question went on with me, and I got a little bit.
Who clean.
No matter how <unk> or where the <unk> <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or Paris or <unk>
Here in New York City, the Department of <unk> <unk> our trash, to the reason of 11 tons of waste and two tons of recyclable products every day.
I wanted to know as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and get that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled on the trucks and walked around his trajectories and I interviewed people in offices and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get more.
So I started working as a trash <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I would <unk>
And operated the mechanical <unk> and <unk> the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as widespread as you believe -- and in the days that it's very strong one <unk> quickly.
It costs a lot of <unk>
I met people who had been working on it for several years, and their bodies were still <unk> the weight of getting on their body tons of garbage every week.
There's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> the waste of waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> of the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and moving into the traffic all day and they pass around you.
They just want to be <unk> so generally the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the worker.
And the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall off the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless garbage.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
It never stopped coming.
It's also like a breathing way or circulation.
You should always be in motion.
And it's also stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I think that the waste <unk> are the most important work in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first protective of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in the waste and effective every day, this starts to <unk> from their <unk> and their dangers are inherent to give us very real ways.
The disease that we had controlled for decades and centuries come back to <unk> and they start to <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old we don't have a space for what the engines of the economy begin to fail when it's in danger of <unk>
I'm not advocating for capitalism, only to me.
And then there is what I call our average speed of everyday daily existence.
And so I mean just at the speed that I used to move in to move in the contemporary time.
We don't usually have any <unk> or <unk> or we have our coffee cup -- our bag of the <unk> our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a work force on the other side that will take away from it.
So today, I want to show you a couple of ways to think about waste waste that maybe will help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable city and human.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when <unk>
And their work allows us to do ours.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that maintain us to get us apart from our own <unk> our <unk> and the flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a collection of waste on the street, grabbed my little son, and I went down the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his job that particular day, but I started to cry.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be fine.
We're going to be right."
Shortly after that, I started investigating the waste <unk> and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together, and we did good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as we have to include and have to account all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor labor.
The city waste -- what we think of when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the <unk> of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next thing you see someone whose job is to clean out the garbage of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you very much.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our communal life being part of the environment where the architecture is born naturally from the conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought together two recent projects as an example of this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives are become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of various floors in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the crystals of <unk> generates heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it's about a temperate weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees in the entire year.
And thirdly, what it looks like is nothing to do with Africa and in Ethiopia.
It's a shame of a place so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really released with the old market that is this structure to the free air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, this was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a building of many stories, by applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the <unk> the site, which is located in a much growth area in a lot of the city, where a lot of the buildings that now we see in the image, not yet.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, <unk> all the inputs on the building.
And this extends out with a <unk> <unk> which creates a space to the free air in the building that is <unk> by its own form, in the sun and rain.
And around this space, we have applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on each floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how close the building?
And I wanted to find a solution that we would engage in local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a fabric like a <unk> concrete <unk> to allow the air to the air, and also from the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons from the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry and this helped me model the <unk>
We are building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and the light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors crystals that use light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it didn't make it easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center -- it was not what they were doing.
But ultimately we all realized that this whole idea of the market was to be much more profitable than the commercial center, because in order there was more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was significantly more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it was no longer necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy <unk> for the building in a city where the electricity takes almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which in a set of water collect water from the inside.
It's expected for the principles of next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a project that big, the biggest thing I have designed, needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, his tradition and culture.
During that analysis <unk> a <unk> <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with 12 doors of access to almost straight.
When I went to place, the first design operation that we did was extend the streets in existing streets, creating 12 similar blocks similar to the size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we choose some strategic points in relation to the idea of interconnected doors with straight lines, and this really changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So we set up a framework that makes sure that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections to the <unk>
And it also responds to local norms that they set up a greater density in higher levels and a lower density on the ground floor.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving out the community to be occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, they can get up and <unk> and do such a form of a <unk> race in the morning or jump from one building to the other.
These two examples, have a common focus on the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally grow.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in life of people changes the communities and local economies at the same rate as buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improves the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had a lot of very bright hair, and a little <unk> of pencils was cute was super strong for the state capitals very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of <unk> until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I stayed at a time after the <unk> I was a little later and I hid in the men's bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> I went into the classroom, I took the lecture back of my teacher to the book of grades.
And then I did.
I would take the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just some of them.
All like --  And I set myself back to the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other guys had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put up all rows of <unk> and myself a row of it, just because of being there, because I <unk>
I'm still surprised by what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I would never get it.
It was that it was all <unk>
I would never be surprised.
But most of all, I was telling me the reason why I was bothered by this <unk> so small, it was so good at <unk>
I love jealousy.
They are so mysterious and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also, the primates. <unk> are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of children to be in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that will observe the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the laboratory that we study <unk> in all its possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's a exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> <unk> there is no literature.
I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> and <unk> and a <unk>
It wouldn't be Shakespeare.
<unk> the high school lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without <unk> there's no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers to everything, and in terms of the <unk> almost all of them.
This year was 100 years of <unk> "In search of time -- the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also of <unk> <unk> -- all that we could have.
We think of a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forget how long it is that image.
We forget about the relentless that it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk> <unk>
I don't know how the cat, <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the <unk> that will be reduced to the person to their wish, to their <unk> are a very good narrative base.
I don't know. I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about the lives of other people, and those stories makes us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel bad.
Being a <unk> and audience, we know exactly what the details of <unk> to nail the knife -- right?
The <unk> are doing all novelists <unk> and that's something that I was trying to understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could make them pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every charm that <unk> detects on his lover -- it adds to his collection of instruments of torture in their private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break on it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a hard job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk> You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> from information.
<unk> use the details.
By <unk> they like great amounts of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> were <unk> from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  -- <unk> links the language with the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> agony of soon listening behind the doors and <unk> to the <unk> of their lover -- then confuse those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's a scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're search of knowledge, search for the truth, a really painful truth -- in fact, what to <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the pathways to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need, that we need to suffer, that we are a very deeper range of feelings that are much deeper and vital that a wise man who can be <unk>
We're saying we're going to search for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> reveal us ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us opening ourselves in this particular way.
There's some other emotion to us -- our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about this later on.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young man who was being consumed with the idea that his woman was doing it.
And Freud said that there was something weird in that man, who didn't get away in what his wife's did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that I was doing his wife, without realizing <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or just accidentally accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
The novels are very good at this.
The novels describe very well how the <unk> makes us look at intensity but without accuracy.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we are, more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to do violent or illegal.
<unk> drives us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself at the age of eight years -- but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman of Michigan from 52 years old was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook from which I was sending horrible messages to itself, for a year.
For one year, every year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former <unk> I have to confess that when I was or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
What massive, even though <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like novel.
Like a novel of Patricia Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of the American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try to do the <unk> with our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of <unk> the membrane that is separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want to want what you have to do with your own and <unk> of whatever you ever <unk> and it's under the floor, <unk> your <unk> your <unk>
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> around the world, as long as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not safe, when they're at a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think of <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> rat <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs <unk> genius, but it bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> it needs their help, but it was <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each one of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once you go inside, <unk> <unk> all over the solution, <unk> it goes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells you that there's no person in <unk> <unk> who didn't want to give you your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> transferred in history. It looks very emotional -- that scene is also essential, right?
It seems like to treat <unk> as a geometry problem without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> is the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they are the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> can be able to figure out that idea of being he <unk>
It could still be so surprised.
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as long as we hope that happens, we remember we have the fiction to <unk>
Only fiction does the jealousy.
The fiction used to get them to the table.
And look at what the sweet <unk> <unk> -- Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21st of July, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the post of Apollo 11 and descended on the Sea of <unk>
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but his presence on the gray surface of the surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the greatest mobilization.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget today.
Apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked about 20,000 companies, universities and universities and government agencies.
They died people, including Apollo crew <unk>
But before the program <unk> <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on the surface of which they went on after Armstrong death last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't release a lot of <unk> 10 pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why do you <unk> The cynical answer is that it was because President Kennedy wanted to show the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some of you ask, why is the <unk>
Why will it turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why is the <unk> mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why would you fly about <unk>
Why does it play Rice against <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the west of this in the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the atmosphere of the powers of technology.
They were because it was a great power to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of <unk> technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it's <unk> the <unk> and <unk> smallpox.
Technology seemed like what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a <unk> ship -- but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10, flew to 40,000 miles an hour.
From 1970, no human being has become the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the optimism mathematics about the power of technology has been <unk> by looking at the problems that we could think of technology to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world population seems to be <unk>
I remember at Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that they didn't go to the <unk> <unk> tube of the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was totally sure that I could see the colonies on Mars.
So that doesn't happen to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it over the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like if the technologists had <unk> us and they were enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed up the sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They <unk> and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, which is that <unk> who have created less ambitious companies that were <unk>   Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, and in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists are offered to entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the investment of risk caused the creation of ideas that are <unk> for the funding of <unk> problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mainly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were in their high point without worrying about risk, they preferred small investment -- investments that could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest with benefit in technologies as energy, that they need an enormous capital and that development is in the long term.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But go to Mars would require a political decision that would be popular and that will never happen.
We won't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption is from sources of renewable energy as solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely economic <unk>
The coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want to be able to do alternative energy sources that can compete at the price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists are according to what policies and international treaties -- the development of <unk> energy -- <unk> a significant increase in research and development of energy, and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we'll see an energy energy policy or international treaties that reflects that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that looked like technological, it turns out not to be.
We know that famines are a result of failure in the <unk>
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are policies that affect <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for the storage and <unk> but there will be <unk> as bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the real problem.
The Golden Nixon declared the war to cancer in 1971, but we soon found that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant to the treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and we can have -- but these four elements have to be <unk> Political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it must be really about a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it serves with those bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition as in the Cold War, there is no policy like John Kennedy that would <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there is no science science fiction mythology like the exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
It was only three days.
And actually, I wasn't even <unk> any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows we don't miss the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Okay, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start to get the ideas that are <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a great decline of trust, it's a very general belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should get the trust.
I think <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a target and a task, that I think gives a more clear idea about it.
First of all, why are people thinking that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It makes me easier to think that there may be <unk> in some activities or institutions and could have increased in others.
I don't have clear.
But I can turn to opinion polls and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at opinion polls over time, there are no evidence for it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, still inspired the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they are still quite <unk> the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly the middle of the way.
But is this evidence enough?
What <unk> opinion are, of course, opinions.
What else can you do?
What you see is the generic generic attitudes that people find when they are doing certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone would be asked, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
Probably <unk> to ask, "What do you do what?"
And that would be a very sensible answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other no."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to make it <unk> trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a certain kind of official official, or a person -- it's going to be a uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say that I trust a certain elementary teacher who I know to give to the English class, but in any way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but not, perhaps, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we left all that knowledge when we think of trust in a more <unk> fashion.
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the true level of real trust, because they are trying to deal with the absolute judgment of the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal that I would have.
I want to have more confidence in what is <unk> trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not trust what it is not reliable.
And I think that those people who were doing their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say it says, yeah, yeah, that's what it matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What this is about making a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that in order to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in the <unk> and it's responsible and <unk> then we have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible for you not to trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they will get their own <unk>
And I'm very glad to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible for us but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still have not <unk>
But that's what we're going to do with them to do before trust.
Trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to do?
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've been trying to build systems on accountability for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and so on, that make us easier for the task to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> that I will attend to <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and <unk> that the system of accountability that is meant to ensure the <unk> and the testing of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know similar examples.
So let's get all of that through the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if they were trying to be worthy of trust, and they will give the people that we are reliable and whether to figure out whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple action, the <unk> what you don't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task rebuilding trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should actually rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, trying to improve the trust.
But trust, in the end, is a signature because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given.
You have to give you the keys enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't get <unk> by all people, all the time.
But you also have to do <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That is a daily basis, everywhere, it makes the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I bought my socks -- he says I can <unk> you without giving <unk>
I take them and get my money, or they change it by the color that I want.
That's great. I'm confident because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson on that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust, and you have trust what you're saying.
So in the end, I think that what we're doing is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people trust is the relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the early early computers we have come up with us to reduce the separation between us and the digital data, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen where the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been <unk> and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everybody.
But I ask myself, and if I had no <unk>
So I started imagining how to <unk>
First of all, I created this tool that was <unk> in the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen is the physical body to <unk>
<unk> can <unk> their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs, underneath the screen.
So with this tool, the barriers.
But the two hands remain still out of the screen.
How can we get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of your hands?
In the Science Science division of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital field of work.
<unk> a very transparent bombsight with cameras deep to detect the fingers and the face, you can now raise the hands of the keyboard, get inside of the three-dimensional space, and grab pixels directly with the hands.
Like the windows and the files have a location in real space -- it's as easy as grab a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book, and you can highlight lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that is down from every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with your hands.
In these examples, we type in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make the digital information come towards us?
<unk> many of us will have bought and turned things across the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a <unk> device or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just looking at pixels in space, how can we make it be physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical player.
This magnet <unk> is perceived as a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> the gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And in programming the object, we released it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can be <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan can be reproduce as a physical reality the times we want.
Students can use it as a tool for understanding complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike the monitors or the textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating to change the physics part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not only going to show you something but to start acting directly on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without having to get rid of our world.
We started talking about a barrier, but if we suppressed that barrier, the only limit that remains is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was excited to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to join a school for athletes with all expenses costs.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed that there was just a <unk> path to <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter whether I'd like it or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera singer there.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could do to go to school school.
I even wrote to the director of school and the news of a radio program.
But no adult <unk> the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends -- but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew that it was too much more to train.
My dream was never <unk>
I think for the rest of my life a second class happiness would be the only thing that I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to look for another <unk>
No one to me wanted to <unk> OK.
We went to books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in 1995, and what were the first books on here?
Those who were <unk> of course.
"The Good <unk> about life Chinese life.
And it is not <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I find a new culture also led to my habit of reading <unk>
<unk> many perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map, I thought it was out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I'd never occurred, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map of the perspective of people.
Space reading is not a new thing.
It's common practice in the academic world.
There is to research camps like comparative religion, and literature.
<unk> and <unk> gives academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if reading comparative reading worked for research, why not do it as well.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For Christ, <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
To the Buddha, they're all <unk> <unk> fear and <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk>
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to get to feel like or <unk>
Having a dream to attract it is really nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of sleep.
His most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, of where the passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
So far as a dream of <unk> I can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always have <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a graduate student in clinical psychology, in Berkeley.
She was a woman who's 26 years called Alex.
And Alex came into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> dropped on the couch my office and told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My classroom had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought the sessions, got me easy to move the head while we get the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and why I looked like, she was right.
You start to work later, she got children later, to death later, to death later.
For <unk> as Alex and I had time to eat.
But shortly after that, my <unk> pushed me to Alex who talk about his life <unk>
I was surprised.
I said, "Yes, it's coming up with guys under his <unk> <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe <unk> with the next.
In addition, the best time to work on marriage is before it was <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> aren't the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they did, but this didn't have the <unk> of Alex to pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And then I realized, this kind of unfinished recklessness was a real problem and had real consequences, not only to Alex and their loving life, but for the careers, the families and future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if they think nobody gets to adulthood without going to happen before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! It's amazing.
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take a <unk> a <unk> I want to see it. It's okay. It's the gay <unk>
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to the age of 35 years.
This means that eight of each 10 decisions and experiences and moments that are given to their life will have happened to when you have 30 and <unk>
People in the <unk>
This public is going to be good, I think.
So we know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know more than half the Americans are married, they live or are coming out with their future couple of years.
We know that the brain ends up the second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and it was <unk> to <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time in life and we know that the female fertility goes to the top of 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment to get them on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment where your daily life and common life has an impact on the person who are <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes on the line of the <unk>
Researchers call <unk> an extended adolescence.
The journalists called it <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines <unk>
<unk> <unk> said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> on your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole it to that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and nothing is absolutely nothing.
And then all the days, <unk> smart, interesting ones, like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend, it's not good for me, but this relationship is not true -- I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that as I start a career before I was a career before the 30, it's all right."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better roles, the day I graduated from his college."
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes on the <unk> were like the chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, it turned the music and everyone started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only person to stay stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair.
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds quite a bit of end, but it doesn't take away the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's a huge pressure to the 30 and so many of them start a career, to choose a city, choosing a couple, and have two or three children in a long time period of time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there's research that starts to show, which is a lot harder and stressful to do all of the <unk>
The <unk> crisis is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want right now.
You realize you can't have the son you want to do now, or you can't give your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was I thinking?"
I want to change what they're doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because he was, in his own words, having a crisis of identity.
He said he would like to work in art or the entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend, which showed more <unk> that ambition.
And despite living with a very difficult time, their previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our sessions, but then it was going to stand up with the saying, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day she got his head on his legs and he cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book to <unk> and I had spent the whole morning with his many <unk> but then you got to see the empty space that follows after the words <unk> for <unk> please call <unk> <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me, and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of if you give me <unk>
At that moment, it took me a lot of work it took me to resist and not say, <unk>
What she needed was not a <unk> that actually was <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the decade <unk> from Emma went forward.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who was <unk> from that identity crisis and <unk> capital capital.
For identity capital, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I know this: capital capital generates identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try to try it.
I'm not <unk> exploration exploration, I'm going to look at exploration that should not count, which, by the way, is not exploration, that by the way, it's not exploration, that by the way, it's not exploration, that by the way, it's not exploration, that by the way, it's not exploration, that by the way, it's not exploration, that by the way, it's not exploration, that by the way, it's not
It's <unk>
I said to Emma who would explore jobs and made them count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to get you to the airport, but the ones that come together with friends with similar minds limit just in the way to who you know, what you know -- how they know how to talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who was going to come out of it almost comes out of his nearest circle.
The new things come from what they call a faint links of friends with their friends.
Yes, half of them have a bad job or don't have work.
But the other half no, and the weak links are the way of <unk> to this group.
The middle of the work has never been <unk> then, to know the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is going on.
And finally, but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma will soon give her family, when he has a partner and part of their own family.
I told Emma that time to choose her family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit in their own head than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live now or get you now -- now when everyone on Facebook start walking towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work on your marriage is before we do it, and that means to be as intentional in love as you're in the work.
<unk> your family has to be a conscious choice of who and what you want instead of only to work to work or kill you who choose you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a cousin of a cousin who worked in a art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That job supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, with the living that I alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves her new family, and I send me a letter that said, "Now the space of contacts are not enough.
The story of Emma might sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like airplanes coming out of Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fits in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or the 25 or even <unk> a good job, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading from all the ones you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to tell Alex.
It's what now I have the privilege of telling <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> aren't the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get their identity -- use their weak connections, choose your own family.
They don't have to define why they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27. I left a very hard job in management <unk> for a job that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach students in seventh grade in New York schools.
And as any teacher, and test test and testing.
I gave them tasks.
When I work back, I went to school grades.
What struck me is that I.Q. wasn't the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance had no <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn when they worked hard and during time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of the students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure better ways.
It's the <unk> but what happens if you're successful in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and in every study -- my question was, who has a success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what they were trying to do in military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National Geographic National <unk> and we tried to predict what children were going to do in the competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in really hard neighborhoods, and <unk> what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school of school and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the learning results of their <unk>
We partnered with private companies asking yourself, what about these marketers are going to keep their work?
And who will make more money?
In all these different contexts, it came up with a characteristic as a major success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and it wasn't I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to your future, day after day, not only the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my <unk> <unk> and then waited about more than a year to see those who are <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly significantly greater likely to come, even when we put them into every characteristic that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the evidence -- even the safety that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or <unk> National <unk> where the <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is the little thing that we know, the science about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you develop the determination for children?
What should I do to teach kids a solid work?
How do I keep keeping them very motivated to <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination is commonly related or even related to result by talent measurements.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination for children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to be <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have forward.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure if they have been successful and we need to be willing to fail, and we need to start to start to start to start to start to start everything again with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother -- the beauty and the shape of the Chinese character.
Since that moment, I was going to get it through this incredible language.
But for a overseas, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great <unk> China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and how to learn Chinese learn Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster, simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy for basic literacy to understand it.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read about traffic signals, <unk> understanding the basic idea of web pages or newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as it might be possible until it's <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I were shouting <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> -- this symbol actually is <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe that it's the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors on the old West.
I call a radical to these eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two is company, two are a company, three are crowd.
If one person stretches his arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth is <unk>
It's a <unk> like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> from remember, because a speaker tree is quite idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two kilograms are very hot.
Three kilograms together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the red moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun goes on the horizon.
One door. You put a board inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is getting hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, are <unk>
Three women together, be <unk>
So we've spent almost 30 characters.
When you use this method, the first eight radical will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters build other 32.
So with every little effort, you'll be able to learn a couple of hundreds of hundreds of <unk> which is the same thing as you learn a Chinese eight years.
So after knowing the <unk> we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth of the <unk>
This is a sun placed in the way, because Japan is to the east of China.
So one sun next to the beginning, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the demo has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be a dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The movie <unk> its imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a bright dress and bring a magic wand set.
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a sort of industrial complex programs of child fantasy programs.
However, the magician of Oz was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took rise to a 40 years later, with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a <unk> guy and a <unk> <unk> <unk> a girl in her <unk>
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two movies, there are a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the <unk>
The monkeys are quite aggressive, like the <unk>
But I think if the magician of Oz has to do today, the magician would say, <unk> you are the salvation salvation like the self-fulfilling prophecy.
<unk> magical shoes to defeat the armies built by the computer of the <unk> <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another single thing about the single magician of Oz is that the most wise and wise characters are women.
I began to notice this when I was able to see Star Wars a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
It's only three years.
I was not invited to projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of <unk> had <unk>  So I was so impressed in the room and was impressed like a foot with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be themes of value, <unk> and <unk>
So it would be the sense that Luke had a army to <unk>
<unk> this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How do you make Dorothy his movie?
<unk> with everyone and a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow up to be <unk> and not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there as much force, F, force in movies for our children, and so little of the road <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> it's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that Princess <unk> doesn't give the proper framework that would have served for me to navigate through the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first shot, I was hoping that the age of the movie, right?
My search has finished, I have a girlfriend.
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on defeat <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and to defend <unk> of Disney at any of you.
But they send a message to children, even though they, boys, are not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job to teach girls how to defend against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show the kids how to defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so real and <unk> as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all times continues to show up in classic after classic each of them on the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and two men who are bringing a little girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in shops.
Do you remember what the criticism was when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie from a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that be <unk>
Well, almost none of these films happens to <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It hasn't yet gotten roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book <unk> and in the 1980s, I recorded a conversation that had had a friend of mine on the assessment of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> in the movie, there's more than a female character who has lines?
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more besides the kid that you like.  Right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things with each other.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet they really rarely see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality movie <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success from <unk> an idea of consensus about what is a Hollywood Hollywood movie.
<unk> doesn't happen the test of <unk>
And I don't think it's going to be <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes from men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the <unk> to take a look at the door and say, "Let's go to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So we went into the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 films that many of them believe that they have <unk> <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently to Congress, then it's okay.
But there is a larger number that this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what it was like,
In the United States, one of five women says it's been sexually assaulted in their life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't believe that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is there is a lot of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do they don't get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very startling statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our disposal as a <unk> <unk> and we hope that we can ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the list of Netflix is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mostly parents.
I think we have to show our male children, a new definition of <unk>
The definition of masculinity is radically changing.
You will have read about how the new economy is changing the role of which you care about home and <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter which was his favorite character from Star Wars you know what I was doing.
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these two?
Maybe it's not just the bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help us get their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I tell my <unk> Go and fight and fight and more stories where it looked like their work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like <unk>
Thank you.
As a girl, I lived in Maine and one of the things that I liked was to look for biscuits on the shores of Maine -- because my parents told me that I was lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered by sand and it's hard to see them.
Yet over time, I was forced to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love of the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up with almost 1.3 miles of length along with <unk>
And my sea biscuits had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
So to try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern realm of Egypt called <unk>
And the place at the naked eye, it seems to be brown -- but when we use infrared and we can process it using false color, suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes in the landscape of construction and the <unk> activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find an old <unk> city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital capital for over 400 years in a time period called the European Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge <unk> drop of <unk>
This area is huge. It's about <unk> for <unk> miles.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk>
And I'll try to find up when you want to be the equivalent of a needle in a <unk> with the <unk> eyes and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA data to make a map of the place, very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area fairly high that you see inside the circle here, which we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians Egyptians making jobs from <unk> they can see here.
When I say <unk> it's like the sample of sample in ice, but instead of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation of it.
Five feet down, under a computer thick we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years that date from the Middle Empire -- exactly the same period as we think it's <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> what shows that there was a <unk> shop there.
This might seem that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Middle Empire -- these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense <unk> of occupation that goes back in the Middle <unk>
We also have evidence of a protective jewelry that shows that what has been there, it was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but we would find it at the place in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology, so they can also make great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Roman Empire -- probably was written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So as it looks, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
And that ideas came really started in 1984 BC.
It certainly puts the pursuit of shells marine in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
So I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk> home.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that is made.
Now let's give a bunch of obese <unk>
They are competing in a <unk> race and they go into their front door.
I need to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide in front of your house.
There's a bikes flying everywhere, wheels that go on their side, the lightning of the wheels that end up in <unk> places, <unk> the threshold of the door <unk>
The lobby, in the hall, or what there is on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light. The light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse on a brown pen.
It's a horse that is speech.
Can you feel your blue dot on your nose.
You can smell the cookie cookie and you go through it to go into the mouth.
<unk> on one side and enter their living room.
In the room, and making use of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing over his hometown of center, singing <unk> One more <unk>
Now let's go back to the kitchen.
The land has been covered with a yellow brick road and from the oven, come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping up to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular contest that is conducted every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist.
There were several men and a few different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- looking at them just once.
<unk> the names of tens and dozens of strangers.
We had entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomenon of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed World, who had come from England and who has one of the best memories <unk>
I said, <unk> when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I am not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
Everybody who's involved in this competition says they have normal memory.
We said, "We have been trained to do these miracle acts of memory using old techniques invented two years ago, in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their narratives -- and the <unk> <unk> used to memorize books.
And my reaction was: How did you have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and bright English -- although a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you're an American American.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of <unk> <unk> on national TV.
That would tell the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the next year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why does it not work and what it can be their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very likely with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows you to see how to point our memory makes us who we are.
At the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He's based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went through a afternoon together in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And to come back, a lot of treaties on memory written about 2,000 years ago in Latin, in Latin, in Latin, and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having memory and <unk> <unk> was not a thing as rare as it might seem to happen today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but we also have changed.
They have changed the top, and I would say that they've changed our cognitive own.
As we almost have no need to remember, sometimes it seems to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where people are still passionate about this idea of a memory and <unk> memory is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there are <unk> like this throughout the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College invited a group of champions to the lab.
They wanted to know -- it will have brains in some way, structural or <unk> different than us?
The answer was, no.
Are they more intelligent than <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually not.
But there was a really interesting difference and significant between the brains of the development of memory and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in a MRI machine, <unk> their brains as they put up numbers, faces and <unk> forms of snow. They found that in the <unk> <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
They <unk> or they seemed like <unk> a part of the brain that involves memory and navigation.
Why? There is something that we can learn from this?
The tournament of the competitive <unk> is running as an armed career, where each year comes up with someone with a new way of remembering more things, and then the rest of competitors must put on a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory of memory.
In his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> from <unk> <unk> who is about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits -- <unk> <unk>

And while there is a lot of ways to remember things in these ability, absolutely all the techniques used at the end of the end is reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
So it illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> <unk> <unk> says the following: I say two people who remember the same word. I'm going to say to you, <unk> there's a man named <unk>
That's his name.
And then I ask you, <unk> that there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them, <unk> that word I told you a <unk>
<unk> which is <unk>
The person who was told that his name is <unk> it's unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that their job is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, it doesn't really mean anything for you. It has no relationship.
With all the other memories that dance on your head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use white <unk>
They have <unk> in hands.
<unk> well when they go home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when I went to that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point after that.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this a half thousand years ago in Victorian Greece
It's known as the <unk> of the <unk>
The story is like this: There was a poet called <unk> which I attended a <unk>
They had hired him like entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, it didn't bring a <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up standing up his memory poem, and he was <unk> and it was just as soon as the <unk> <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But it didn't only kill everybody, but it shattered the body to <unk> <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where you were sitting there.
So they wouldn't be able to <unk> the <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
<unk> stopped outside, only <unk> in the bottom of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where he had been sitting around here.
I took the family of <unk> hand where they were their loved ones on the rubble.
What <unk> <unk> at that point is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we're not good at remembering or phone numbers or the word <unk> or the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial memory.
If you were to tell me that I was the first 10 words of the story I've just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very hard to do it.
But I would bet if you ask you to tell you who sitting on the white brown horse in the lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace is to create this building with the eyes of his mind and <unk> images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago to the first treaties of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it from memory, in the same way that I would have done it -- if you had been invited to spend 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine that they're on the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help you remember the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that will remind you that they want to introduce Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then you play in the kitchen, and the room would speak to be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how the speakers <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not word for word, which is going to be confused but typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> when people thought about <unk> and the rhetoric in the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first -- it would be like the first place in his palace of memory.
And I saw that this was just a fascinating, and I got full of it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> <unk> event.
And seriously, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting on board -- I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone was getting rid of the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning before I sit to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient <unk> school <unk>
And I discovered this was fun.
I would never have expected I would be.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it is actually about doing is better to get more and more the ability to create and imagine these images of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
And I was really stuck with this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
This is a couple of <unk> and a pair of safety covered with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory.
I ended up coming back to the same competition that he had covered a year before. I had the idea that I could put on a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be a good <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's cute to be able to memorize narratives and phone numbers, and <unk> but actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks.
Because they're based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build the memory of the memory or memorize <unk> to benefit from a little <unk> about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
The more basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on deeply.
The palace of <unk> these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk> actually.
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete care that most people are not <unk>
But the reality is that there's not shortcuts.
This is how things are <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today is what the <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what is already our <unk> existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks around our side, we will be so <unk> that we don't even stand at process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person that remember <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, and so we would have just a <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was six years ago, and I lived there in my parents' house in a village called <unk> and this was my child's bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that shared with my sister.
And in my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there they all spent the time looking at television -- so every time I was going from my room to the bathroom, I all looked at me and every time I stood up, and I would be wrapped up in a <unk> I all saw me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> nowhere else hated it.
I put that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
<unk>
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, or of production production, but of those connections that are emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like we feel like this, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under ceiling.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
So this means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you would do, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know you think about it because in a building built two years ago, by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an amazing emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build the banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, a solid deal in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because we build things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> <unk> and governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> which ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has this <unk> thing, columns, red, and you leave <unk> what is trying to communicate with this <unk> children, the values of property, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, ended up another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital age.
It's a new type of equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So what is it possible in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects who are constantly driving new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for the current life.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> so far away from the people.
All of the black, this tells us -- you think we feel very good, but we're dead because we don't have another option.
We need to go to the other side and come back with these symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we started to experience <unk> we make the pendulum back to go ahead and over and over again, so we've done this in the last 300 years, and of course in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago I was <unk> from the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
Can you be able to guess.
<unk> small, <unk> scale.
Something really hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those shapes that we know I like and <unk>
<unk> neon and we add a bake and we use a new material.
They love it.
We don't take <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we became a <unk> that can be <unk> <unk> made from glass.
The forms are <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
<unk>
But they were the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, and we moved to the slums, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic fantasies <unk>
These fantasies could be <unk> to the French, or the Italian <unk>
They may be able to have a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy. They're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories of other places.
I know very well, and all of you know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started making <unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols <unk> now we have new <unk> design techniques -- and we find new <unk> a few ways that were <unk> against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> One is totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when an academics and general public and general were completely agreed on a building.
The New York Times <unk> <unk> this building of <unk>
<unk> of Bilbao grew up in a half thousand percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Chicago, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everyone wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these forms and wild and radical how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media is going on around them, and we quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same mayors did the top mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new 21st century country with other parts of star.
It went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to happen with all of the architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think of it, for example, how do we use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have been walking up to the next town to see a building.
<unk> can take a boat, a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology can be seen in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers of architecture, and the building is led beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, so that means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is going to move that fast, because architecture is going to move so fast.
You don't need a long time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings more than knowing if that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a two years, but 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen, <unk> because we are at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or the elevator -- and it's the media revolution.
So my theory is that when it applies to the media, it starts to <unk> and getting faster, until it's going to be on both extremes almost in <unk> and <unk> effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, architects and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in New York City.
It's a holiday community.
But that meant two years before the building, was already part of the community -- and as the drawings looked exactly the product finished, not surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people began to come up and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became an communication, because these are not only images of a building, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that you made the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building could be built today, first of the Internet is looking for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and tell you that there's no answer only to what a library can be a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> public not seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't get rid of the architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> from a style to another, of a movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems that society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a <unk> historical brick of red brick with ideas of what it has to be a stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we'll finally be ready for ways that are going to produce.
That means that buildings will be <unk> to the <unk> of nature, and not the opposite.
This means that a garage garage in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve to make sports or for <unk> or even you can get married there at night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming in the East Side of New York, and to raise half a million dollars in the community around that cause, it's no longer a client alone.
It means that any building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot that builds our buildings.
No matter how we built, what matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make more green buildings, more <unk>
We've been waiting for everybody to you.
Finally, we are no longer <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give them way to the most prestigious spaces -- local libraries -- the homes where we formed our children, and the step of the room at the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned out to be a year and he started walking.
And it makes it a great way of the children of a year, <unk> as if your body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is to look in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
They laugh and <unk> and it gives itself those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
You know, apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and it made me think, when stopped doing this?
How do we suddenly be <unk> with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for you, "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and it lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, it just wants to be dear to fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom tells him all the while it's beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
In addition to what his mom tells him and what your friends, or school colleagues say, don't know who I believe.
So a video of her own, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks other than please leave a <unk> I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has gotten over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a very normal healthy teenager, who gets these answers into one of their most vulnerable life of their living life.
Thousands of people are posting posting like this, in their most teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's going to do this?
Well, the teenagers today almost never are alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we have been that connected, in a continuous way, very young.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in his room all the <unk>
There are just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment will be always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they liked and the kinds of comments they get.
There's no division between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it is.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what's authentic and what is <unk> <unk>
What is the most prominent in the life of someone in front of what is normal in a <unk> context.
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the girls of the girls now.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what the young men are.
But kids are not immune to this.
Like the <unk> stars in sports and the singers <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we surely want our children to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in an obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and effort to their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects start to suffer.
Six out of six of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't look very nice enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and as <unk> to society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the debates of class.
One of five are not <unk> at all kinds of days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of tests, if you don't think you look at good enough, specifically if you don't think you're a little bit thin, you can get a smaller note to the average of your peers who don't care about that as appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, America and China, and China.
And it gives it irrespective of what these young people are.
So, to be clear of course, we are talking about how you see not how you're really like,
The low self-esteem of your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with a little self-esteem make less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they participate in better diet that they can bring them to a food <unk>
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people who are around them, and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all over this because of what they make more <unk> decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drug consumption and drugs, diet <unk> artificial relationships to early ages and <unk> damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women believe that they are <unk> again, regardless of whether they have no higher rates of <unk>
On 17 percent of women are not presented to an interview interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way you see it.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, which would be that <unk>
<unk> this potential is in interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, by itself, doesn't take you very far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways -- the first one is that we need to instill in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very impressed when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children follow our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are crucial <unk> for anyone willing to provide an education in body self-esteem that works.
A education is a fundamental thing, but dealing with this problem requires each of us to take the reins on the issue, and we're a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
So challenging the status of the way women are seen and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to count on the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of your <unk> or <unk> that determination or success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people for what they are, not as you see it.
All of us can begin to do that by assuming the responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can help people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you when it was the last time you had a <unk>
In short, we need to work together as communities, as governments and businesses, to really change our culture, so that our children will grow to valuing their whole person, valuing the individuality, diversity, <unk>
We need to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that go out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they are not going to be <unk> to be who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who are you in your mind?
A <unk>
A <unk>
A <unk>
To her <unk> A <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is two car seats -- what would it mean for her if he was liberated from that voice <unk> in his interior, he would be able to get it out of a long legs -- <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her, if we did this, and we would make it free of your potential in that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images is coming back to us all.
But we <unk> our children the truth.
So what you think is that the way you see you are just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and so they do, and because of how they make us feel.
They bring to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little <unk> of a year of age today, becoming insurance agents of themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On the five of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
They were initially <unk> who was innocent. but being jail for other charges -- in the company of others, started planning for about 12 icons in New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Luckily those plans was taken by an FBI informant by the FBI.
Sadly, the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center, couldn't be able to avoid.
Later on, <unk> would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer <unk> with a <unk> American mother, teacher -- the two did all the way for me to give me a happy partner.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims are coming to meet.
For experience I saw when people take time to <unk> it doesn't require a lot to get the same things in life.
However, all of religion, in all human group, there's always a small fraction of people who are so <unk> to their convictions that thinks we have to use all of the potential means to all live like them.
A few months before he arrest him he sat with me and explained to me that in the last weekends, he and some friends, had been going to training training in Long Island to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> that, without knowing our group, I was <unk> by the FBI.
When my father touched me my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to aim for about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot gave the little orange light on the goal, and for surprise all, especially me, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle turned to the other and in Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such a son.
And all of all, the comment gave them a lot of laughter. But only a few years later understood what they found so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could be <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of putting a van <unk> with 700 kilos of explosives in the southern tower of the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and <unk> other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called it <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times that instability during my childhood didn't allow me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about somebody who was time to pack and go to another city.
As I was always a new face of the class that was often a victim of <unk>
<unk> <unk> my identity to avoid being the white -- but I'll be the new of the class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I went home by reading books, watching TV or playing games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to say <unk> to grow under <unk> was not prepared for the real world.
I was <unk> opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they got to test my way to test my thinking, was during the presidential elections in 2000.
In a <unk> program where I was involved in the <unk> National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the juvenile violence, because I had been a victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the convention, I discovered that one of the kids who we had done friendship, was Jewish Jew
I took a number of days coming out of the light, and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud of being able to beat the barrier that all life had been made me to believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment arose when I got a summer job in Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found myself with people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience turned out to the development of my character.
All life had taught me that the <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay <unk> were bad <unk>
By chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that many of them were the most nice and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been <unk> of a kid, I developed a sense of empathy to suffering from others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat real people, exactly the way I wish to be treated.
So I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that homosexual is, but I know what it's going to be tested for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart made me <unk> honest about my <unk> and helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, don't have anything to do with the character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> figure at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
On occasions, inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my own life than my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother on how I was changing my thinking, and she told me something that I hold in my heart forever, while it's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes of someone who has suffered enough <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why would I go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done this because I hope that someone, one day, who is trying to lead to violence, you can hear my story and understand that there's a better way to be able to get me to this ideology violent and <unk> I didn't get me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones for their loved pain and loss that terrorism has led to their lives.
By the victims of terrorism to talk to those <unk> acts like rejection of my father's actions.
So with this <unk> I put up here as a proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race. That children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
So at this point there is a movie that's projected in their minds.
It's an incredible <unk> movie.
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and you see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> flavor and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your <unk> your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like moments of your childhood that you project in front of your eyes.
And it has a <unk> voice.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything in light.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths to be human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie -- you, you and you.
There is nothing to do more directly.
At least I know that I have a <unk>
I don't have any certainty that you're aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of anything in our lives it would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why have these films <unk>
Why are we not only robots that we're going to do to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this moment, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness in science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
The science of nature, is objective itself.
<unk> for nature, is subjective disease.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all of the 20th century, we will get that vision.
The psychology was studying behavioral behavior, neuroscience is studying the brain -- but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there was very few scientists on consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> as Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science to <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a flowering of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the time.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years, was the pursuit of <unk> correlations among some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that I wore Nancy <unk> a few minutes.
We now understand a lot better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience to see faces or feel happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of <unk>
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of human experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to saying that this kind of work of neuroscience responds some questions that we want to explain consciousness -- the questions about what certain areas of the brain and what certain areas are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
Not to offend the <unk>
There are actually no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it's not tackles the real mystery of this <unk> Why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
At this moment, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like the <unk> like the <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The classic <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors -- how do they operate <unk> how they work <unk> how they <unk> are adapting and <unk> the living organisms are all questions about how we work.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we <unk> how we play -- how we play <unk> they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, questions about behavior are among the very easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why this is all behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that would work. For a long time, I would hit my head against a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end, I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to stay at this point.
We have a very cool chain of explanations -- we get used to this, physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're aware of.
For another, we don't know how to break that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think consciousness right now, is kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate our worldview in the world, but we don't know still how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning, <unk> <unk> before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There's some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Her crazy idea is that there is no such hard problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain -- the brain behaviors -- and this is what everything needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> consciousness, based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many other people, that vision is pretty close to simply denying that the observation of consciousness is satisfying to <unk>
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> bricks and time and the mass.
<unk> laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of nothing more basic terms.
Instead, they considered fundamental principles, and there is the world.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't tell the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts <unk> space, time -- <unk> laws -- so <unk> the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the electric charge as a fundamental concept than those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation where we meet consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas <unk> space, time, mass, charge, then for logic, we have to <unk> the list.
The most natural would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space -- time, the dough, the dough, the mass, the physical.
<unk> sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can see them in a t-shirt.
We don't know what laws are, but that's what we do.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for everyone, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not just human beings, the dogs, the mice, the flies, the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of heartbreak when you think about my God, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that perhaps photons can have some element of crude sense of <unk> some <unk> precursor to consciousness.
This might sound a little crazy for you.
How would anyone think about something that crazy?
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, which consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space and time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's a lot less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems to be a continuum with nature.
One more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that we're going to solve thinking with the physical process, is <unk> awareness with information.
Because there's always information processing, and it's awareness.
<unk> <unk> complex as in a human being, consciousness complex.
<unk> of simple information -- simple awareness.
Something really exciting is that in the recent years, a <unk> <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed <unk> with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of understanding information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated in a system.
And it's supposed to be about consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there's a degree of information, as well as significant degree of consciousness -- quite important.
But when you get to the <unk> microbes, you particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of zero.
In fact providing a fundamental law of <unk> <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers often have observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It takes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality of the reality below.
As Stephen Hawking's Hawking's "Where are the fire of the <unk>
From the <unk> view, the equations of physics can leave as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in equations.
In that view, consciousness is not outside of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision -- I think, vision <unk> has the potential to make our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had consciousness, then I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you take that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think this is going to transform your vision, while what matters in ethical terms and moral terms, is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
It has a vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, these are very serious ethical problems about the ethic of the development of intelligent computers and the ethical <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of <unk> <unk> the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group like the audience at a TED Talk, right now we have a collective collective consciousness -- a internal movie for this whole group of TED, different from the internal movie of each <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that has to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually sure the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing, than the second of the second that it's universal.
So the vision raises a lot of questions, so many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go through the right path to a serious consciousness theory.
If not, well, it's probably the most difficult problem in philosophy.
We can't wait to solve that overnight.
But I think we will finally be able to find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, a very normal profile, a <unk> of education.
I went to school, I went to my friends, I would love with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there is a surprising problem.
She's actually not getting anything."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low-performing profile in my mother, and spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability outside of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school of <unk> as only after about 20 minutes in the class, 11 minutes <unk> a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when to give your <unk>
And I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in chairs of wheels, they talk about things going on at school?"
<unk> in the classroom.
And it was then when I realized, this child had had experiences with disabled people like inspiration.
And we don't are. And it's not the fault of the boy, that is, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We are there to <unk>
And in fact, I'm on this stage, <unk> to what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you to <unk> Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we have lied us in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold the lie that disability is something <unk> A capital <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you <unk>
It's not bad and it doesn't make you <unk>
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
It may be you've seen one of the little girl who was drawing with a pen with the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the porn term -- <unk> because he <unk> a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we were going to engage the disabled in the benefit of people with no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, by very bad than my life, could be worse.
I could be that guy.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that I've been dealing with strange <unk> to express who believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my job had a public profile.
It was as if I stood up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are going to be given to people with disabled people for people with no disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard person.
We had some things.
But the things that we don't are not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I became a social model of disability, that tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
It makes things that I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They are just using their bodies by getting the best of their ability.
So, it's really fair to be <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says like a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've sold us this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, I don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here -- the inspiration -- and you think, "Oh my God, you're not sometimes inspired by something that was involved.
And I actually know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability all over time.
However, I don't know that I'm so lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to collect the things that fall over.
Great.
We learn about the force and resilience of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that you have sold us about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that <unk> "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles to a X-ray X-ray hasn't made it to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> to a television screen will not get the <unk> for people to <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books to the <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a six-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> don't be considered no <unk> of nothing to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of the people with disability that we are <unk> to get out of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a kid at 11 grade in a high school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think to know what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the reality of augmented reality and professional football with the <unk>
And what is the average velocity of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'll just respond to one of those questions, so you don't get a <unk>
When people think about "Minority <unk> think of "Minority <unk> and by Tom <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools to do that, and people need to know, because reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing <unk> Google Glass.
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
Let me experience what is to be a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I tried to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would engage with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and know what is run by the field of play to 160 <unk> the blood beat the ears.
We can know that it feels like a <unk> man -- we were trying to get it out of your self.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
And I took some videos to show you what is to use Google <unk> underneath the helmet, and give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of <unk> practices because the idea of the <unk> technology is a submarine up to the surface -- but we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A little bit of <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is to be <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have realized that we need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue <unk> Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to the feeling being in the field, but there's nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, will be their favorite players, and you have asked me to YouTube and in <unk> You can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how we go from <unk> how we get it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that surely many of you know it.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, <unk>
No, no, no, no. I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> This is the experience of a man in a Russian mountain, they would take her life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before you run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball to the bottom of the network?  Or you could make a <unk> in <unk>
What is their experience when it comes from a mountain to more than 100 miles a <unk>
You might have <unk> the sales sales <unk>
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality.
How do we get the reality to <unk> <unk>
<unk> augmented reality when I tested them, the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So, here's a quick test on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> put a <unk> to their field of field to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put in radii in the <unk> <unk> and then in their defenses.
They were more <unk> because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that it's a player going back to your group and see your next step shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you're wearing on. You don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
<unk> the strategy.
They just go out into the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose them, they lose <unk>
If you lose parties, you get a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way of playing the game.
How do you do that?
Well, a very simple choice would be to have a camera in every corner corner -- having a view from the top of the people that's below.
You also get information from the <unk> <unk> and <unk> something that is already working.
And all of that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad ones will have information <unk>
This brings the good teams of the bad guys.
So your computer equipment will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being <unk>
It's also going to be <unk> Who would have figure.
How would it be in <unk>
Imagine that it's the field <unk>
<unk> the ball and <unk>
<unk> to a <unk> <unk> suddenly a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- you know, a defense behind you is going to <unk> you don't know it, but the system of <unk> will get you.
They went to the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you have a open <unk>
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where the Earth is, however, the receptor sees in its bombsight a patch of grass that lights and can change the race.
<unk> takes <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The <unk> public and the fans have been followed by one angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion on the game.
So I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, <unk>
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I wonder is, we want this to be the only use of reality.
We're going to use it just as bread and <unk> like our <unk>
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy among human beings to show someone how it is, literally, to be in the other person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of revenue a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are their actions from <unk> perspective.
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how they live being <unk>
How much is it worth a <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, reality augmented reality.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> as well, of us.
Thank you.
Recently I was <unk> after 23 years in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years old, I was <unk> the southern end of the county of <unk> County that includes the bridge <unk> <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known to globally about its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The bridge <unk> has been opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer the master of building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
Violence from the bridge is not practical or <unk>
But from his openness, more of 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will bring them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that every single time you released from all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a fall of four to five seconds, the body hits about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks off the bone, some of which we are making <unk> organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones that don't normally be <unk> in the <unk> water, and then they <unk>
I don't think that those of you who have a suicide method tells you about <unk> death to which they were <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people were before they took life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in its dark moment, it's very hard to bring it back.
I took this picture last year as I was talking about with a officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that day to bring it back into the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have formal training.
<unk> to channel the path through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those of you who spend suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, officials and psychologists train the new government <unk>
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at the top of 22 <unk> of last year when I got a call from a possible subject in the <unk>
<unk> and when I got there, I saw Jason talking to Jason talking to a bridge of the bridge <unk>
Jason was just 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, it had flown up here two times before in New Jersey to try to kill suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
From her <unk> <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> he leaned on the right, and he left.
This guy in New Jersey in New Jersey had just taken my life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, he didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family was called to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had an order.
<unk> damage about suicide affects a lot of people.
I give you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody were suicide <unk>
What do you find?
<unk> what that?
In my experience, you don't only have to talk, but you need to listen to.
Listening to understand.
They don't <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how it feels like, because you probably don't know.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point they need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> in the same circumstances have thought to end their life, you've had these <unk>
They were going to be saving the person in front of their life and will be the inflection point for them.
Other signs at <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to <unk> <unk> believe there's nothing that you can do with <unk> social feelings and a lost of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son at 19 of January, this year, and he wrote this email only a couple of days, and he is with his permission and <unk> I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I guess you're at TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the party of 49 with his father on the 19 of January.
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house and reported that the car car was down on the bridge.
A witness I'd seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting those who can be temporarily too weak to fight themselves.
Who has not been before bad without suffering a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the <unk> Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11th of 2005, I wrote a radio call by a <unk> <unk> on the sidewalk bridge near the north.
I took my breath on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When I saw it, immediately the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the time and a half after, I heard like Kevin spoke about his depression and <unk>
Kevin decided to come back to that day and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin turns out to him.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked her, "What was it that made it <unk> and <unk> the hope and life of life.
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
I stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the <unk> mother and I have that letter with me, and I'd like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> nothing erase the <unk> events and you're one of the reasons why Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly <unk>
<unk> Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious from all those traits -- but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as the says.
We give God for you.
<unk> in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she writes <unk> <unk> When I visited San Francisco at San Francisco that night, you <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I know I had to do it.
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and active member of society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and their depression with hope that their story will inspire others.
suicide is not just something that I've found in the work.
It's personal.
My grandfather killed me with poison.
That act, despite the end of his own pain, I knew the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who consider the suicide, you wouldn't think to hurt another person.
They just want your own pain.
They usually have three things: sleep, sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and calls from suicide around the bridge.
Of those incidents in which I've been directly involved with I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who spoke to him about an hour.
During that time, I got my hand at three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact with in that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, these few of them have jumped from the bridge and lived and you can talk about it, that one or two percent, most of those people have said that the second thing they leave on side the railing they realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect to <unk> with San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or bridge that we make, is something that everyone and each of us must be able to work for doing.
Sex can prevent.
There is help.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your inside you know what you are, and a question will you, how do you become that?
I have to be a single thing in that sense, but I'm not alone any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally achieved the dream I had ever had since I was a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth.
For complicated reasons, the ones that I'm going to talk about later, when I look at this picture, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm going to start.
We're all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of the skin or the beliefs of those who surround us.
These are people who are always challenging the status quo -- which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my most even, I ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
I had been recorded as <unk> because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, at my house, I was always wearing this shirt in the head.
And my mom wondered, "Why do you always wear that shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair -- I'm a <unk>
I knew then how do you <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never told me to share my story, not because I thought that being a bad thing, but how the world is treating those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have a mama, dad and a family who will accept me as I am.
Many aren't so lucky.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a Hindu goddess goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage, and I remember this beautiful woman came in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> me, this is the kind of woman I want to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I still wear a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the CEO of a <unk> <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if he <unk> she was responsible for <unk> and <unk> and the night, I won in a bathroom, he won in <unk> and he was <unk> in a <unk> of over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people say that their first job was from <unk> of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when they went to remote <unk>
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom. I had moved to San Francisco, and he called me and told me that passed my request from the green card that I could go to live in the U.S.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a <unk> queen here.
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know that if you gave the U.S. and you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested that I had two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand to 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most sophisticated <unk> surgeries and secure.
At that time in the United States, it was necessary to be done with surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears were <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and moved to New York, and to be model.
Many aren't so lucky.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who <unk> lived in his truth, but that, <unk> put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of the 20, of November we do a global waking percent of <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long story of people who were <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't still keep my truth alive and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that someday there is no longer more <unk> than 20 <unk>
My deepest truth took me to accept what I am.
Will you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> first, thank you with all my <unk>
My parents support my parents in particular, to my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young young women who have come up with me and sometimes when they were being called, and told me that their parents could not accept it, I took the phone, called my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- others don't. It's only what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all gave a gender at birth, and what I try to do is to put on the table the subject that sometimes that <unk> <unk> and there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be a space for curiosity and ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice <unk> Thank you.
In many <unk> and tribal societies, the parents are usually known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for her daughter, and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending their rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> their efforts in 2011, to <unk> the <unk> National <unk> was made very <unk> a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when when you were born a girl, his birth won't be <unk>
It's not totally, not by his father, not by his mother.
The neighborhood comes, gives her <unk> to mother and nobody <unk> a father.
And a mother <unk> a lot for having a child.
When you give birth to the first girl, the first child, the first daughter, <unk>
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he was <unk> his third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just the suffering, but the daughter, <unk> <unk> when it grows, it suffers too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, you get home and school fifth to her brothers.
At the age of 12 years, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move down the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes in the adolescence, when it was 13 years old, you want to go out of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes called the honor called his father and his brothers and his siblings and her family, and if you <unk> the code.
And it's interesting that this assumption code of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> also affecting the lives of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters in behalf of course honor.
And there's a standard of the <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl has to be very <unk> and very <unk>
It's the <unk>
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be <unk> and that embracing the decisions of their father and their mother and the decisions of the elderly even if you don't will.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if I did it with an old man he has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk> from <unk>
If the <unk> too young, it has to take it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then it gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter, and the same lesson of honor his children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so before I was going, I thought of her name, and I was fascinated with a great <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter so for her.
But when I was excited, they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she turned it out, when I was four and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a <unk> in my school.
Can you ask, why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yes, I must <unk>
You can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in the tribal societies, in tribal societies is a great event for the child life.
<unk> in a school means recognition of his identity and his name.
A <unk> to school means that it's entered the world of the dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for the future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they were <unk> the form of Canadian visa and was in the relative part to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason why value to my daughter.
What my father couldn't give to my sisters and his daughters, thought he had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
<unk> to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to do it in your personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all of these good values in my school to girls and boys for the same.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught the students, forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves a new phenomenon.
It was lethal rights for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all social and economic and social <unk>
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the girls <unk> and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, <unk> stood up and raised by the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, he was offered her right for the New York Times, and I spoke at every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> across the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign, and the October nine of 2012, was shot in the head.
It was a day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I read my ear to my wife -- "I must <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> he said, "Please, don't you <unk>
<unk> the right cause.
<unk> your life in play by the cause of peace, and by the cause of peace, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
They were both on the right way and God <unk>
These few words would be a lot for me, and I didn't ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital, and I had severe headaches and heavy headaches because his facial nerve was <unk> I used to see a dark shadow that was going on the face of my wife.
But my daughter would never be <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile, <unk> and I had my face.
I'm going to get right. Please don't be <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the most difficult moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women, it's like any <unk> girl.
<unk> when he didn't end his job.
They fight with their siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What's about special in my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> so audacious and expressive and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
He didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain about 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I recently joined the Google <unk> of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did before I joined Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there's a stigma when you get to a brain operation for the brain.
Are you still as smart or not?
If you're going to be going to be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray, matter, but it was the dead sticky part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to make, more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to <unk> to follow life.
More than I've been saved by recently.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I would be able to try to get the doses of <unk> because it doesn't really have a clear map that says it in <unk>
I started to test a different mix with different <unk> and I was shocked by looking at how little changes in the overwhelming dose, my sense of who was me, my sense of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried a dose of a few months, and the typical chemicals for a <unk> man, and I was surprised by watching my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past -- or maybe some versions of it.
It turned out as a extreme.
But my great surprise was, I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit <unk> fixing a problem that I had on the front, and it simply wouldn't happen like this.
So I couldn't deal it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of men and about what they have to do, since then I get better with men.
So what I was trying to do is we adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, I was to recover my intelligence after disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I think about almost always in pictures, and that became my key point of reference to how to get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> and new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things in the same way.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are those who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental imaging are fundamental to the thinking and <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> -- we really get very sophisticated sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images, of my mind to the computer screen of my mind.
Can you imagine what would happen if a theater director could be able to use his imagination only to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could get the music from your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way people creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to accomplish this is simply going to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments that made by two groups that was that in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, MRI imaging -- functional magnetic resonance to represent the brain. You can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain of a person who looks at an image.
The column in the middle shows the scan of the brain of that same individual as it was <unk> looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column of the left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between looking at an image and imagine seeing that same image.
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from Harvard Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They were able to turn the brain waves into <unk> visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, it showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were <unk> their brains to create a large range of reactions of the brain in the video.
And then I showed you a movie with new images, new people, new animals, and while they were <unk> a new <unk>
The computer, using only brain information, scanning it to show what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right, you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're okay to do this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you look at an image and when you imagine that same image, it creates the brain the same <unk>
This has been conducted with the brain scanning brain systems available today, and its resolution in a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution for a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we achieve that?
There are lots of techniques to do it.
One is to open up the skull and you get a electrodes.
I don't give it for that.
Many are proposing new techniques to projection from images, even me, <unk> with the recent MRI result -- first we must ask the next thing, this technology will be the end of the way.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way that the only way to get greater resolution is with larger, but at this point, magnets more <unk> only offer small improvements in resolution -- not increases by thousands of as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of larger magnets -- make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements -- like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI was to make really big magnets -- right?
However, most of the advances in recent advances in <unk> of clever solutions and brilliant solutions and <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and receptors in MRI systems.
At its time, instead of a magnetic field, <unk> magnetic patterns that are vibrating at the frequencies of radio <unk>
So as we combine magnetic patterns with the patterns of the patterns of radio radio processing, we can actually increase the information that you can extract in one <unk>
In addition, we can then divide in layers our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
When we use the <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid, but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even the neural activity -- this is the dream. This is sleep.
We will be able to put our ideas in a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go through language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be limited, used to use our thinking of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few more options than open this door.
Anyway, choose a year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'll talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
Her closet may be saying to some person for the first time you love to say to someone who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have done in life.
So I'm all a hard conversation -- and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have come from that closet is universal.
Day fear, and we don't like it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working on the South Side of the <unk> <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through various stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, <unk> the letters of <unk>
And I will be slope by the <unk> of my own <unk> and I had my head <unk> my head was a little bit of a kid, "Hey, you're a guy or <unk>
And it would appear a silent silence on the table.
I took my jaw a little bit further, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother <unk> a cold, look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and <unk>
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised my next time I would say something.
So I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence, but this time I was ready and was about to go into the female conversation on the table.  I had the quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a glimpse of the "Vagina Monologues," <unk>
And then you take a deep breath and I lowered my eyes and my back, a four year-old girl with a pink dress looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just one girl with a question: "You're a kid or <unk>
So I just take a very deep breath again, I stood up to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is <unk>
I have the short hair like one of a boy, and I saw a boy, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a <unk> <unk>
I am more than a girl of a <unk>
And that little girl looked at me who was paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all like, "Oh, OK. You're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the difficult conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> the one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and I know, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what the lines are the walls.
You just know how one feels like a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from you or yours or yours.
I would give you a hundred reasons for why out of my closet was harder than getting out of his, but this is the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> it's not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who have declared on online <unk> is harder to say that it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story is harder to tell your five years that you're going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult, there is just the hard thing.
We need to stop classifying what is hard to do with respect to what it is difficult for other people to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we must just feel empathy because we all live in a hard thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they may make sense security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine themselves 20 years ago.
And I, who had a horse tail, a dress.
It was not the <unk> lesbian to fight against any four-year-old kid who would fit in coffee.
I was frozen by fear -- <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my grenade gay, and the moving only muscle is the most scary thing ever done.
My family, my whole strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was turning back to purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> to kill you.
One of the most memorable grenade in my sister.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew I was gay, and by doing my lady from honor, in my black dress and <unk> I walked around the tables and finally came up with one where the friends of my parents, people I knew I was doing before.
And after talking a moment, one of the women cried <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay account had started.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite program Will <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but hopefully I'm desperately going to show your support, to get me to know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirts, <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as they have all the Scud <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for how authentic you are."
It's like the hard conversations still remain my strong point.
Ask for anyone who I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please see this through a gay perspective, but you understand that what it involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the cafe had no <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> others need to know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> Just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they are gay, you know.
If they say their parents could be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  <unk> the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be done by that.
And some of you may be able to get out of injured injured -- so they have done, but they're never sorry about what they are.
And yes, maybe some will feel <unk> but that's something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you might feel very yourselves, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has seen the intelligence -- a productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that the question of if a machine can think is as interesting as the question of if a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critical <unk> of computing as Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, I had a program to try to understand the fundamental underlying physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a walk.
So let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from a <unk> race that you don't know about the biology of Earth or the neuroscience of Earth or intelligence on Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason it would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from an alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept of intelligence on Earth, you would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how to a certain time in time, the asteroids that will take on the surface of a <unk> planet.
And so I claim this is the same question that the same question as understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took a number of years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that I think, I think, towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be very accurately at the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that will address the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in a robotic movement planning there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to make complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different themes and <unk> together, I said, for a number of years ago, there is a very underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for the <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the nearest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is an assertion that intelligence is a strength, F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or maintain the open options with a force T, with the diversity of possible future accessible, Yes, to an impending future, <unk>
In a few words, intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain the open.
And so, having to realize this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human <unk>
Do the intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life should have trend for more favorable conditions for intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually emerges directly from her?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy in any system in any system that can be found.
Amazingly, <unk> could spend multiple testing of animal intelligence, play computer games, and even making money <unk> actions, all of that without being asked to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human foot without <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave it a goal.
He just decided to be able to balance the <unk>
This ability of equilibrium will have applications for humanoid robotics and human care technologies.
This capacity of tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate throwing away from opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> <unk> new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly <unk> and keeps the network right connected.
This same capacity of network <unk> also has applications in health care, in energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering success and using the Panama Panama to extend the world level from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense issues, logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discover and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of <unk> <unk> by increasing assets under their exponentially.
This ability of risk management will have huge applications in finance, and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of marks of smart cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all derive from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back at the beginning of the term of the term -- the <unk> play, there was always the concept that if <unk> intelligent machines would have a smart rebellion in it.
The machines were <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all of the concept of rebellion to <unk>
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all right, that the urge to take the control of every possible future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise directly from taking control instead of being backwards.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the target.
They often ask me, how is it that looking for goals are coming into this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to move to the descendants of them to help them build artificial <unk> or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We are at a turning point in human history, something between the stars of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Even over the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge so much of how the Earth works in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets of our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope, which measures the dim <unk> intensity of the stars when the planets go ahead of them, and blocking a little bit of that light that comes to us.
The data gathered over Kepler shows the sizes of the planets besides the distance that there are between them and their mother.
In <unk> this helps us to understand if these planets are small, and <unk> like the Earth planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their <unk>
At their time, this gives clues about if these planets that we find are livable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
<unk> was the <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us since now, since now, are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused to the global scale have <unk> our ability to disrupt their course.
But I'm not a weather scientist but I'm not <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where we find life beyond our planet.
You might say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in the search for life in the universe, I can tell you that the more I'm looking for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further away from the Sun, it can be a potentially livable world demonstrated that this by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been livable in the past, and in part, is why we study both to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> track its surface in search of clues about clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the <unk> atmosphere and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies now offer not just short space flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images are <unk> they remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas <unk> and <unk> compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still remain by <unk> places in comparison with Mars.
Even in the most dry and highest places on Earth the air is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement through the colonization of Mars and other planets will drag out with a great and sad <unk> the implication, and the belief of some that Mars will expect to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly <unk> the Earth.
And so I like exploration exploration, I'm deep disagree with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but say Mars will be there to <unk> humanity is how to imagine that the captain of the Titanic tells us that the party is going to be place later in the <unk>    Thank you.
But the goals for exploration exploration, and the land preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces from the same <unk> the goal of understanding and to improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
It's only about home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> in the hostile and <unk> areas of land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with an experiment with the <unk> paradox.
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi said, "I had to realize that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider to be in between the stars, they lose the notion of how important the planets are to protect the origin of the planets that we're going to embrace this development.
It's arrogant to think that only the colonization of us will save us from ourselves, but <unk> <unk> and <unk> exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to break into the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking in my pockets, I realized I had no keys.
In fact, I could see by the window that they were at the dining table, where I had <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows and windows, and they were all fine closed.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get to get it cold.
I couldn't go back to my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had a flight in Europe in the next morning, and I was <unk> from my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but it's sure not more expensive than a half ago than a half ago, so I thought that despite the circumstances, I lived well.
I'm a <unk> and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rhythm, <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to the counter counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to wonder, if there was something I could do, systems that I could put in their place, which would make bad things happen.
Or at least, if things happen to bad things, that we will make the chance of being a total catastrophe as well.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later my thoughts were <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed I told him that I was <unk> and, I had forgotten my <unk> and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called <unk> hindsight <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written a few years before, known as the <unk>
You all know what's the <unk>
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that might be wrong, then trying to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the harm.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
At the house, they will make a place for things that are very easily.
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a track of the location of the important things, where all the fish are, where the fish are, that there are the fish that they live in their own friends and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that goes into the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that lets you find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone actually did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They didn't use the nose, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move too good for things that move too much.
This is the reason for losing your car <unk> and <unk>
So at home, I would have a place for keys, a hook up next to the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your <unk> a particular feeling.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you look at a place and they are <unk> with it your stuff will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take the cell phone -- a picture of your credit card cards, <unk> <unk> <unk> for email itself to be in the cloud.
If these things lose or <unk> this can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
